Ergatis is a flexible workflow management system for designing and executing complex bioinformatics pipelines. However, its complexity restricts its usage to only highly skilled bioinformaticians. We have developed a web-based prokaryotic genome annotation server, Integrative Services for Genomics Analysis (ISGA), which builds upon the Ergatis workflow system, integrates other dynamic analysis tools and provides intuitive web interfaces for biologists to customize and execute their own annotation pipelines. ISGA is designed to be installed at genomics core facilities and be used directly by biologists. Availability: ISGA is accessible at http://isga.cgb.indiana.edu/ and the system is also freely available for local installation.
