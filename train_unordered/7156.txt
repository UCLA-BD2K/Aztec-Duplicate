As sequencing becomes cheaper and more widely available, there is a greater need to quickly and effectively analyze large-scale genomic data. While the functionality of AVIA v1.0, whose implementation was based on ANNOVAR, was comparable with other annotation web ser-vers, AVIA v2.0 represents an enhanced web-based server that extends genomic annotations to cell-specific transcripts and protein-level functional annotations. With AVIA's improved interface, users can better visualize their data, perform comprehensive searches and categorize both coding and non-coding variants. Availability and implementation: AVIA is freely available through the web at http://avia.abcc. ncifcrf.gov.
