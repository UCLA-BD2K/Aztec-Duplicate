We present a tool called MRSD (Metabolic Route Search and Design) to search and design routes based on the weighted compound transform diagraph. The search submodule returns routes between a source and product compound within seconds in the network of one or multiple organisms based on data from KEGG. The design submodule designs a route from an appointed compound in an interactive mode.
