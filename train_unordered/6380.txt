Motivation: RUbioSeq has been developed to facilitate the primary and secondary analysis of re-sequencing projects by providing an integrated software suite of parallelized pipelines to detect exome variants (single-nucleotide variants and copy number variations) and to perform bisulfite-seq analyses automatically. RUbioSeq's variant analysis results have been already validated and published. Availability: http://rubioseq.sourceforge.net/.
