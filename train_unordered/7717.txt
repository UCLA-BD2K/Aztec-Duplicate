Currently available bisulfite sequencing tools frequently suffer from low mapping rates and low methylation calls, especially for data generated from the Illumina sequencer, NextSeq. Here, we introduce a sequential trimming-and-retrieving alignment approach for investigating DNA methylation patterns, which significantly improves the number of mapped reads and covered CpG sites. The method is implemented in an automated analysis toolkit for processing bisulfite sequencing reads. Availability and implementation:
