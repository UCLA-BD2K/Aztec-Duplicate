Motivation: The development of molecular markers is one of the most important challenges in phylo-genetic and genome wide population genetics studies, especially in studies with non-model organisms. Highly promising approach for obtaining suitable markers are the utilization of genomic partitioning strategies for the simultaneous discovery and genotyping of a large number of markers. Unfortunately, not all markers obtained from these approaches provide enough information for solving multiple evolutionary questions at a reasonable taxonomic resolution. Results: We have developed DOMINO, a bioinformatics tool for informative marker development from both NGS data and pre-computed sequence alignments. The application implements popular NGS tools with new utilities in a highly versatile pipeline specifically designed to discover or select personal-ized markers at different levels of taxonomic resolution. These markers can be directly used to study the taxa surveyed for their design, utilized for further downstream PCR amplification in a broader set taxonomic scope, or exploited as suitable templates to bait design for target DNA enrichment techniques. We conducted an exhaustive evaluation of the performance of DOMINO via computer simulations and illustrate its utility to find informative markers in an empirical dataset.
