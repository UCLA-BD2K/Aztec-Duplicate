Gene expression or metabolomics data generated from clinical settings are often associated with multiple metadata (i.e. diagnosis , genotype, gender, etc.). It is of great interest to analyze and to visualize the data in these contexts. Here, we introduce INVEXâ€”a novel web-based tool that integrates the server-side capabilities for data analysis with the browse-based technology for data visualization. INVEX has two key features: (i) flexible differential expression analysis for a wide variety of experimental designs; and (ii) interactive visual-ization within the context of metadata and biological annotations. INVEX has built-in support for gene/metabolite annotation and a fully functional heatmap builder. Availability and implementation: Freely available at http://www. invex.ca. Contact:
