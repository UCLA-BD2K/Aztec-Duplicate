GraphWeb is a public web server for graph-based analysis of biological networks that: analyses directed and undirected, weighted and unweighted heterogeneous networks of genes, proteins and microarray probesets for many eukaryotic genomes;integrates multiple diverse datasets into global networks; incorporates multispecies data using gene orthology mapping; filters nodes and edges based on dataset support, edge weight and node annotation; detects gene modules from networks using a collection of algorithms; interprets discovered modules using Gene Ontology, pathways, and cis-regulatory motifs
