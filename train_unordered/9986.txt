Motivation: DOOSS (Data Overlaid On Secondary Structures) is a tool for visualizing annotated secondary structures of large single-stranded nucleotide sequences (such as full-length virus genomes). The purpose of this tool is to assist investigators in evaluating the biological relevance of secondary structures within particular sequences. Availability and implementation: DOOSS is written in Java and is available from: http://dooss.
