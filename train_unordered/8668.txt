R/DWD is an extensible package for classification. It is built based on a recently developed powerful classification method called distance weighted discrimination (DWD). DWD is related to, and has been shown to be superior to, the support vector machine in situations that are fundamental to bioinformatics, such as very high dimensional data. DWD has proven to be very useful for several fundamental bioinformatics tasks, including classification, data visualization and removal of biases, such as batch effects. Earlier DWD implementations, however, relied on Matlab, which is not free and requires a license. The major contribution of the R/DWD package is an implementation that is completely in R and thus can be used without any requirements for licensing or software purchase. In addition, R/DWD also provides efficient solvers for second-order-cone-programming and quadratic programming. Availability and implementation: The package is freely available from cran.r
