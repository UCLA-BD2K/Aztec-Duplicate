ANAIS is a user-friendly web-based tool for the processing of NimbleGen expression data. The interface reads single-channel microarray files generated by NimbleGen platforms and produces easily interpretable graphical and numerical results. It provides biologists six turnkey analysis modules—normalization, probe to gene, quality controls, differential expression, detection, queries and clustering—to explore quickly, freely and without the need for computer programming, NimbleGen transcriptome data.
