Motivation: Given the abundance of genome sequencing and omics data, an opprtunity and challenge in bioinformatics relates to data mining and visualization. The majority of current bio-informatics visualizations are implemented either as multi-tier web server applications that require significant maintenance effort, or as client software that presumes technical expertise for installation. Here we present the Visual Omics Explorer (VOE), a cross-platform data visualization portal that is implemented using only HTML and Javascript code. VOE is a standalone software that can be loaded offline on the web browser from a local copy of the code, or over the internet without any dependency other than distributing the code through a file sharing service. VOE can interactively display genomics, transcriptomics, epigenomics and metagenomics data stored either locally or retrieved from cloud storage services, and runs on both desktop computers and mobile devices. Availability and implementation: VOE is accessible at
