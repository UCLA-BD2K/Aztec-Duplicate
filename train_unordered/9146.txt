GEPdb integrates both genome-wide association studies and expression quantitative trait loci information, the two primary sources of genome-wide mapping for genotype–phenotype and geno-type–expression associations together with phenotype-associated gene lists. The GEPdb provides simultaneous interpretation of both genetic risks and potential gene regulatory pathways toward phenotypic outcome by establishing the ternary relationship of geno-type–expression–phenotype (GEP). The analytic scope is further extended by linkage disequilibrium from five different populations of the international HapMap Project. Availability and implementation: http://ercsbweb.
