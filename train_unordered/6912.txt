Sequence–structure–function information is critical in understanding the mechanism of pMHC and TR/pMHC binding and recognition. A database for sequence–structure–function information on pMHC and TR/pMHC interactions, MHC-Peptide Interaction Database-TR version 2 (MPID-T2), is now available augmented with the latest PDB and IMGT/3Dstructure-DB data, advanced features and new parameters for the analysis of pMHC and TR/pMHC structures.
