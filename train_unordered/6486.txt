We describe here the ncIDP-assign extension for the popular NMR assignment program SPARKY, which aids in the sequence-specific resonance assignment of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs). The assignment plugin greatly facilitates the effective matching of a set of connected resonances to the correct position in the sequence by making use of IDP random coil chemical shifts. Availability: The ncIDP-assign extension is available at http://www.protein-nmr.org/.
