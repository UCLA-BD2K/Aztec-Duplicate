Motivation: Drug effects are mainly caused by the interactions between drug molecules and their target proteins including primary targets and off-targets. Identification of the molecular mechanisms behind overall drug–target interactions is crucial in the drug design process. Results: We develop a classifier-based approach to identify chemogenomic features (the underlying associations between drug chemical substructures and protein domains) that are involved in drug–target interaction networks. We propose a novel algorithm for extracting informative chemogenomic features by using L 1 regularized classifiers over the tensor product space of possible drug–target pairs. It is shown that the proposed method can extract a very limited number of chemogenomic features without loosing the performance of predicting drug–target interactions and the extracted features are biologically meaningful. The extracted substructure–domain association network enables us to suggest ligand chemical fragments specific for each protein domain and ligand core substructures important for a wide range of protein families.
