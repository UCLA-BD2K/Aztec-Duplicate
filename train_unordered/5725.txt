The Deductive Application Language System ( DeALS ) is a next-generation Datalog system. DeALS supports recursion, negation, and built-in and user-defined aggregates. DeALS also supports advanced features including XY -Stratified Datalog , which is a type of locally stratified Datalog , and aggregates that can be used in recursive rules. With support for many powerful constructs, a wide range of complex applications can be expressed. Three execution engines for DeALS have been designed and implemented namely, a sequential Java-based interpreter for prototyping and testing, a multi-core parallel C++ implementation and a distributed implementation on Apache Spark.
