Here, we describe a tool suite that functions on all of the commonly known FASTQ format variants and provides a pipeline for manipulating next generation sequencing data taken from a sequencing machine all the way through the quality filtering steps. Availability and Implementation: This open-source toolset was implemented in Python and has been integrated into the online data analysis platform Galaxy (public web access: http://usegalaxy.org; download: http://getgalaxy.org). Two short movies that highlight the functionality of tools described in this manuscript as well as results from testing components of this tool suite against a set of previously published files are available at
