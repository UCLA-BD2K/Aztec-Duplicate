Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip has a complex array design, and the measurement is subject to experimental variations. The ENmix R package provides tools for low level data preprocessing to improve data quality. It incorporates a model based background correction method ENmix, and provides functions for inter-array quantile normalization, data quality checking, exploration of multimodally distributed CpGs and source of data variation. To support large scale data analysis, the package also provides multi-processor parallel computing wrappers for some commonly used data preprocessing methods, such as BMIQ probe design type bias correction and ComBat batch effect correction.
