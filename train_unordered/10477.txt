We propose SW#, a new CUDA graphical processor unit-enabled and memory-efficient implementation of dynamic programming algorithm, for local alignment. It can be used as either a stand-alone application or a library. Although there are other graphical processor unit implementations of the Smithâ€“Waterman algorithm, SW# is the only one publicly available that can produce sequence alignments on genome-wide scale. For long sequences, it is at least a few hundred times faster than a CPU version of the same algorithm. Availability: Source code and installation instructions freely available for download at
