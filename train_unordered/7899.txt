Motivation: Genome-scale metabolic networks are widely used in systems biology. However, to date no freely available tool exists that ensures quality control during the reconstruction process. Results: Here, we present a COBRA toolbox extension, rBioNet, enabling the construction of publication-level biochemical networks while enforcing necessary quality control measures. rBioNet has an intuitive user interface facilitating the reconstruction process for novices and experts. Availability: The rBioNet is freely available from http://opencobra .sourceforge.net.
