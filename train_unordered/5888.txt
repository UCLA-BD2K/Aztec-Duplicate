Aeskulap is a medical image viewer for Linux and Windows. It provides for viewing of local files and can query PACS servers and fetch images from them. The goal of this project is to create a full open source replacement for commercially available DICOM viewers. Aeskulap is based on gtkmm, glademm and gconfmm and designed to run under Linux. It is available in source format, compiled for several versions of Linux, and through some Linux package installers such as yum (Fedora/Red Hat Linux).
