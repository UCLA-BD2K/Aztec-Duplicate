Motivation: Ultra-deep sampling of small RNA libraries by next-generation sequencing has provided rich information on the microRNA (miRNA) transcriptome of various plant species. However, few computational tools have been developed to effectively deconvolute the complex information. Results: We sought to employ the signature distribution of small RNA reads along the miRNA precursor as a model in plants to profile expression of known miRNA genes and to identify novel ones. A freely available package, miRDeep-P, was developed by modifying miRDeep, which is based on a probabilistic model of miRNA biogenesis in animals, with a plant-specific scoring system and filtering criteria. We have tested miRDeep-P on eight small RNA libraries derived from three plants. Our results demonstrate miRDeep-P as an effective and easy-to-use tool for characterizing the miRNA transcriptome in plants.
