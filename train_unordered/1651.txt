We provide efficient, easy-to-use tools for High-Throughput Sequencing (ChIP-seq, RNAseq etc.). These include MDS plots (analogues to PCA), detecting inefficient immuno-precipitation or over-amplification artifacts, tools to identify and test for genomic regions with large accumulation of reads, and visualization of coverage profiles.
