Nucleotide Similarity Scanner (NSimScan) is specialized for searching massive DNA databases for distant similarities. Its targeted applications include phylogenomics, comparative and functional studies of non-coding sequences, contamination detection, etc. NSimScan outper-forms industry standard tools in combined sensitivity, accuracy and speed, operating at sensitivity similar to BLAST, accuracy of ssearch and speed of MegaBLAST. Availability and implementation: NSimScan is available at https://github.com/abadona/qsimscan as a part of QSimScan package. It is implemented in C þþ, distributed under MIT license and supported on Linux, OS X and Windows (with cygwin).
