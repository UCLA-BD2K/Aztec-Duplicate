FTProd is a plugin for VMD designed to characterize and identify cross-structural 'hot spots' in proteins. The program FTMAP identifies these druggable hot spots by docking a series of small molecular probes onto the protein surfaces. FTProd combines these output structures, clusters them, and displays them visually for easy comparison.
