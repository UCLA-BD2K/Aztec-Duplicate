Motivation: The Full-text index in Minute space (FM-index) derived from the Burrows–Wheeler transform (BWT) is broadly used for fast string matching in large genomes or a huge set of sequencing reads. Several graphic processing unit (GPU) accelerated aligners based on the FM-index have been proposed recently; however, the construction of the index is still handled by central processing unit (CPU), only parallelized in data level (e.g. by performing block-wise suffix sorting in GPU), or not scalable for large genomes. Results: To fulfill the need for a more practical, hardware-parallelizable indexing and matching approach , we herein propose sBWT based on a BWT variant (i.e. Schindler transform) that can be built with highly simplified hardware-acceleration-friendly algorithms and still suffices accurate and fast string matching in repetitive references. In our tests, the implementation achieves significant speedups in indexing and searching compared with other BWT-based tools and can be applied to a variety of domains. Availability and implementation: sBWT is implemented in C þþ with CPU-only and GPU-accelerated versions. sBWT is open-source software and is available at
