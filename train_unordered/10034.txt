The quality of high-throughput next-generation sequencing data significantly influences the performance and memory consumption of assembly and mapping algorithms. The most ubiquitous platform, Illumina, mainly suffers from substitution errors. We have developed a tool, ACE, based on K-mer tries to correct such errors. On real MiSeq and HiSeq Illumina archives, ACE yields higher gains in terms of coverage depth, outperforming state-of-the-art competitors in the majority of cases. Availability and implementation: ACE is licensed under the GPL license and can be freely obtained at https://github.com/sheikhizadeh/ACE/. The program is implemented in Cþþ and runs on most Unix-derived operating systems.
