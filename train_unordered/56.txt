CellBase implements a set of RESTful web services that query a centralized database containing: (i) core features such as genes, transcripts and exons or proteins; (ii) regulatory elements such as transcription factors (TFs) and TF binding sites, microRNA (miRNA) and curated and non-curated miRNA targets or CpG islands; (iii) many functional ontologies from Open Biomedical Ontologies (OBO) Foundry; (iv) variation data such as single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), phenotypic-related SNPs, known mutations or structural variation and (v) systems biology information such as pathways or protein interactome.
