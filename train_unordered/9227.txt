Motivation: The prediction of the iron–sulfur proteome is highly desirable for biomedical and biological research but a freely available tool to predict iron–sulfur proteins has not been developed yet. Results: We developed a web server to predict iron–sulfur proteins from protein sequence(s). This tool, called MetalPredator, is able to process complete proteomes rapidly with high recall and precision. Availability and Implementation: The web server is freely available at: http://metalweb.cerm.unifi. it/tools/metalpredator/.
