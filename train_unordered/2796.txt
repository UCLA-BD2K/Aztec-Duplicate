Dynamic expression data, nowadays obtained using high-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), are essential to monitor transient gene expression changes and to study the dynamics of their transcriptional activity in the cell or response to stimuli. FunPat is an R package designed to provide: - a useful tool to analyze time series genomic data; - a computational pipeline which integrates gene selection, clustering and functional annotations into a single framework to identify the main temporal patterns associated to functional groups of differentially expressed genes; - an easy way to exploit different types of annotations from currently available databases (e.g. Gene Ontology) to extract the most meaningful information characterizing the main expression dynamics; - a user-friendly organization and visualization of the outcome, automatically linking the differentially expressed genes and their temporal patterns to the functional information for an easy biological interpretation of results
