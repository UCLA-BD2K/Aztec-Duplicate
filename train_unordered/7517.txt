Motivation: The reference CRAM file format implementation is in Java. We present 'Scramble': a new C implementation of SAM, BAM and CRAM file I/O. Results: The C implementation of for CRAM is 1.5–1.7Â slower than BAM at decoding but 1.8–2.6Â faster at encoding. We see file size savings of 34–55%. Availability and implementation: Source code is available at http:// sourceforge.net/projects/staden/files/io_lib/ under the BSD software licence.
