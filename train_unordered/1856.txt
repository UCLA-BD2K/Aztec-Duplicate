Functions for simulating and plotting cancer progression data, including drivers and passengers, and allowing for order restrictions. Simulations use continuous-time models (based on Bozic et al., 2010 and McFarland et al., 2013) and fitness functions account for possible restrictions in the order of accumulation of mutations.
