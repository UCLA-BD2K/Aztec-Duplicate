Motivation: Finding geometrically similar protein binding sites is crucial for understanding protein functions and can provide valuable information for protein–protein docking and drug discovery. As the number of known protein–protein interaction structures has dramatically increased, a high-throughput and accurate protein binding site comparison method is essential. Traditional alignment-based methods can provide accurate correspondence between the binding sites but are computationally expensive. Results: In this article, we present a novel method for the comparisons of protein binding sites using a 'visual words' representation (PBSword). We first extract geometric features of binding site surfaces and build a vocabulary of visual words by clustering a large set of feature descriptors. We then describe a binding site surface with a high-dimensional vector that encodes the frequency of visual words, enhanced by the spatial relationships among them. Finally, we measure the similarity of binding sites by utilizing metric space operations, which provide speedy comparisons between protein binding sites. Our experimental results show that PBSword achieves a comparable classification accuracy to an alignment-based method and improves accuracy of a feature-based method by 36% on a non-redundant dataset. PBSword also exhibits a significant efficiency improvement over an alignment-based method. Availability: PBSword is available at
