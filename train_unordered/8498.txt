DREAM: detecting RNA editing associated with microRNAs, is a webserver for the identification of mature microRNA editing events using deep sequencing data. Raw microRNA sequencing reads can be provided as input, the reads are aligned against the genome and custom scripts process the data, search for potential editing sites and assess the statistical significance of the findings. The output is a text file with the location and the statistical description of all the puta-tive editing sites detected. Availability and implementation: DREAM is freely available on the web at
