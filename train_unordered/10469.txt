Recent major cancer genome sequencing studies have used whole-genome sequencing to detect various types of genomic variation. However, a number of these studies have continued to rely on SNP array information to provide additional results for copy number and loss-of-heterozygosity estimation and assessing tumour purity. OncoSNP-SEQ is a statistical model-based approach for inferring copy number profiles directly from high-coverage whole genome sequencing data that is able to account for unknown tumour purity and ploidy.
