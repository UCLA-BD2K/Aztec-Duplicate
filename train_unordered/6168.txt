We describe an R package designed for processing aligned reads from chromatin-oriented high-throughput sequencing experiments. Pasha (preprocessing of aligned sequences from HTS analyses) allows easy manipulation of aligned reads from short-read sequencing technologies (ChIP-seq, FAIRE-seq, MNase-Seq,. . .) and offers innovative approaches such as ChIP-seq reads elongation, nucleosome midpoint piling strategy for positioning analyses, or the ability to subset paired-end reads by groups of insert size that can contain biologically relevant information. Availability and implementation: Pasha is a multi-platform R package, available on CRAN repositories under GPL-3 license (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Pasha/).
