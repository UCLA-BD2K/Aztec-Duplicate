We introduce a novel implementation in ANSI C of the MINE family of algorithms for computing maximal information-based measures of dependence between two variables in large datasets, with the aim of a low memory footprint and ease of integration within bioinformatics pipelines. We provide the libraries minerva (with the R interface) and minepy for Python, MATLAB, Octave and Cþþ. The C solution reduces the large memory requirement of the original Java implementation, has good upscaling properties and offers a native parallelization for the R interface. Low memory requirements are demonstrated on the MINE benchmarks as well as on large (n ¼ 1340) microarray and Illumina GAII RNA-seq transcriptomics datasets. Availability and implementation: Source code and binaries are freely available for download under GPL3 licence at http://minepy.source-forge.net for minepy and through the CRAN repository http://cran.r-project.org for the R package minerva. All software is multiplatform (MS Windows, Linux and OSX).
