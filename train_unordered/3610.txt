BWA-PSSM is a probabilistic short read aligner based on the use of position specific scoring matrices (PSSM). Like many of the existing aligners it is fast and sensitive. Unlike most other aligners, however, it also adaptible in the sense that one can direct the alignment based on known biases within the data set. It is coded as a modification of the original BWA alignment program and shares the genome index structure as well as many of the command line options.
