It is difficult for current simulation tools to simulate sequence data in a pre-specified pedigree structure and pre-specified affection status. Previously, we developed a flexible tool, SeqSIMLA2, for simulating sequence data in either unrelated case-control or family samples with different disease and quantitative trait models. Here we extended the tool to efficiently simulate sequences with multiple disease sites in large pedigrees with a given disease status for each pedigree member, assuming that the disease prevalence is low. Availability and implementation: SeqSIMLA2_exact is implemented with Cþþ and is available at
