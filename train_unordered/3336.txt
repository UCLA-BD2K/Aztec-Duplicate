GPCRDB contains data, diagrams and web tools for G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). Users can browse all GPCR crystal structures and the largest collections of mutants. Diagrams can be produced and downloaded to illustrate receptor residues (snake-plot and helix box diagrams) and relationships (phylogenetic trees). Reference (crystal) structure-based sequence alignments take into account helix bulges and constrictions, display statistics of amino acid conservation and have been assigned generic residue numbering for equivalent residues in different receptors.
