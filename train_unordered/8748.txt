Dose–response information is critical to understanding drug effects, yet analytical methods for dose–response assays cannot cope with the dimensionality of large-scale screening data such as the microarray profiling data. To overcome this limitation, we developed and implemented the Sigmoidal Dose Response Search (SDRS) algorithm, a grid search-based method designed to handle large-scale dose–response data. This method not only calculates the pharmacological parameters for every assay, but also provides built-in statistic that enables downstream systematic analyses, such as characterizing dose response at the transcriptome level.
