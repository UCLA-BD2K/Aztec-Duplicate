The Expression Atlas database provides information on gene expression patterns under different biological conditions. It consists of two components: the 'differential' and 'baseline' atlases. The Differential Atlas, containing both microarray and sequencing data, allows users to query which genes are up-/down-regulated in different experimental conditions, e.g. 'in Arabidopsis shoots, what genes are upregulated in plants treated by X?' The Baseline Atlas, containing exclusively RNA-seq data, displays expression levels of gene products under 'normal' conditions (e.g. normal human tissues).
