Motivation: The reasons for distortions from optimal-helical geometry are widely unknown, but their influences on structural changes of proteins are significant. Hence, their prediction is a crucial problem in structural bioinformatics. Here, we present a new web server, called SKINK, for string kernel based kink prediction. Extending our previous study, we also annotate the most probable kink position in a given-helix sequence. Availability and implementation: The SKINK web server is freely accessible at http://biows-inf.zdv.uni-mainz.de/skink. Moreover, SKINK is a module of the BALL software, also freely available at www.ball
