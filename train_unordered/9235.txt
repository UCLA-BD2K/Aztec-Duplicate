Enumeration of the dense sub-graphs of a graph is of interest in community discovery and membership problems, including dense sub-graphs that overlap each other. Described herein is ODES (Overlapping DEnse Sub-graphs), pthreads parallelized software to extract all overlapping maximal sub-graphs whose densities are greater than or equal to a specified cutoff density of at least 1/2.
