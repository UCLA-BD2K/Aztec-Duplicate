hmChIP is a database of genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) data in human and mouse. Currently, the database contains 2016 samples from 492 ChIP-seq and ChIP-chip experiments, representing a total of 170 proteins and 11 069 914 protein–DNA interactions. A web server provides interface for database query. Protein–DNA binding intensities can be retrieved from individual samples for user-provided genomic regions. The retrieved intensities can be used to cluster samples and genomic regions to facilitate exploration of combinatorial patterns, cell-type dependencies, and cross-sample variability of protein–DNA interactions.
