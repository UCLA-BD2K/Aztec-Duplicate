Identifying causal variants remains a key challenge in post-GWAS (genome-wide association study) era, as many GWAS single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (including imputed ones) fall into non-coding regions, making it difficult to associate statistical significance with predicted functionality. Therefore, we created a web-based tool, Enlight, which overlays functional annotation information , such as histone modification states, methylation patterns, transcription factor binding sites, eQTL and higher-order chromosomal structure, to GWAS results.
