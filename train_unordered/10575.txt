Mass spectrometry (MS) is widely used for isotopic labeling studies of metabolism and other biological processes. Quantitative applications—e.g. metabolic flux analysis—require tools to correct the raw MS data for the contribution of all naturally abundant isotopes. IsoCor is a software that allows such correction to be applied to any chemical species. Hence it can be used to exploit any isotopic tracer, from well-known (13 C, 15 N, 18 O, etc) to unusual (57 Fe, 77 Se, etc) isotopes. It also provides new features—e.g. correction for the isotopic purity of the tracer—to improve the accuracy of quantitative isotopic studies, and implements an efficient algorithm to process large datasets. Its user-friendly interface makes isotope labeling experiments more accessible to a wider biological community. Availability: IsoCor is distributed under OpenSource license at
