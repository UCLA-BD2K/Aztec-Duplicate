We report on a major update (version 2) of the original SHort Read Mapping Program (SHRiMP). SHRiMP2 primarily targets mapping sensitivity, and is able to achieve high accuracy at a very reasonable speed. SHRiMP2 supports both letter space and color space (AB/SOLiD) reads, enables for direct alignment of paired reads and uses parallel computation to fully utilize multi-core architectures.
