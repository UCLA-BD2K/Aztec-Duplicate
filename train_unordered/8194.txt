Motivation: The ability to detect copy-number variation (CNV) and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) from exome sequencing data extends the utility of this powerful approach that has mainly been used for point or small insertion/deletion detection. Results: We present ExomeCNV, a statistical method to detect CNV and LOH using depth-of-coverage and B-allele frequencies, from mapped short sequence reads, and we assess both the method's power and the effects of confounding variables. We apply our method to a cancer exome resequencing dataset. As expected, accuracy and resolution are dependent on depth-of-coverage and capture probe design. Availability: CRAN package 'ExomeCNV'.
