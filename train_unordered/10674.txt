The mesoscopic statistical physics models, known generically as Peyrard–Bishop (PB) models, have found many applications for the study of oligonucleotide properties. Unfortunately, PB models have not reached a wider non-specialized audience for the lack of freely available software implementations. Here we present an exten-sible Cþþ implementation of four variants of the PB model, which allows the user to calculate melting temperatures from tested model parameters. Even for a non-specialist, it should be straightforward to change these parameters to reflect different experimental environments or different types of oligonucleotides. For users with some proficiency in Cþþ programming, it should be feasible to extend the code to other PB models owing to the generic programming implementation adopted for TfReg. Pre-calculated parameters are included that allow the immediate calculation of melting temperatures and thermal equivalence indexes for DNA and RNA. Availability: Cþþ source code and compiled binaries for several Linux distributions are available from https://sites.google.com/site/ geraldweberufmg/tfreg and from OpenSuse build service at http://
