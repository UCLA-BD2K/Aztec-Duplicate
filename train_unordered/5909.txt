FSL is a comprehensive library of analysis tools for FMRI, MRI and DTI brain imaging data. It runs on Apple and PCs (both Linux, and Windows via a Virtual Machine), and is very easy to install. Most of the tools can be run both from the command line and as GUIs ("point-and-click" graphical user interfaces). To quote the relevant references for FSL tools you should look in the individual tools' manual pages, and also please reference one or more of the FSL overview papers:
