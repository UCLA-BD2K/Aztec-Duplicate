Ligand protein docking simulations play a fundamental role in understanding molecular recognition. Herein we introduce the NRGsuite, a PyMOL plugin that permits the detection of surface cavities in proteins, their refinements, calculation of volume and use, individually or jointly, as target binding-sites for docking simulations with FlexAID. The NRGsuite offers the users control over a large number of important parameters in docking simulations including the assignment of flexible side-chains and definition of geometric constraints. Furthermore, the NRGsuite permits the visual-ization of the docking simulation in real time. The NRGsuite give access to powerful docking simulations that can be used in structure-guided drug design as well as an educational tool. The NRGsuite is implemented in Python and C/Cþþ with an easy to use package installer. The NRGsuite is available for Windows, Linux and MacOS. Availability and implementation: http://bcb.
