The K-PACS Workstation is a powerful DCMTK-based DICOM viewer that provides tools for manipulating, measuring and converting DICOM images into several formats. Additionally, the software implements the most important DICOM service classes like store, query/retrieve, send and move. Thus you can query picture archives comfortably, download pictures, upload foreign pictures to archives and export pictures on CD, on local hard drive or via email.
