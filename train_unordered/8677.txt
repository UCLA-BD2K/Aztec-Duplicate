The R/Bioconductor package girafe facilitates the functional exploration of alignments of sequence reads from next-generation sequencing data to a genome. It allows users to investigate the genomic intervals together with the aligned reads and to work with, visualise and export these intervals. Moreover, the package operates within and extends the ever-growing Bioconductor framework and thus enables users to leverage a multitude of methods for their data in order to answer specific research questions. Availability and Implementation: The R package girafe is available from the Bioconductor web site: http://www.bioconductor.org/ packages/release/bioc/html/girafe.html An extensive vignette and the Bioconductor mailing lists provide additional documentation and help for using the package.
