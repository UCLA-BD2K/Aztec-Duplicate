Motivation: Computational modeling of protein–DNA complexes remains a challenging problem in structural bioinformatics. One of the key factors for a successful protein–DNA docking is a potential function that can accurately discriminate the near-native structures from decoy complexes and at the same time make conformational sampling more efficient. Here, we developed a novel orientation-dependent, knowledge-based, residue-level potential for improving transcription factor (TF)-DNA docking. Results: We demonstrated the performance of this new potential in TF–DNA binding affinity prediction, discrimination of native protein– DNA complex from decoy structures, and most importantly in rigid TF–DNA docking. The rigid TF–DNA docking with the new orientation potential, on a benchmark of 38 complexes, successfully predicts 42% of the cases with root mean square deviations lower than 1 A ˚ and 55% of the cases with root mean square deviations lower than 3 A ˚. The results suggest that docking with this new orientation-dependent, coarse-grained statistical potential can achieve high-docking accuracy and can serve as a crucial first step in multi-stage flexible protein–DNA docking.
