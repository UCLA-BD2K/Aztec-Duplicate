This package implements sampling, iteration, and input of FASTQ files. The package includes functions for filtering and trimming reads, and for generating a quality assessment report. Data are represented as DNAStringSet-derived objects, and easily manipulated for a diversity of purposes.  The package also contains legacy support for early single-end, ungapped alignment formats.
