A multiway method to decompose a tensor (array) of any order, as a generalisation of SVD also supporting non-identity metrics and penalisations. 2-way SVD with these extensions is also available. The package includes also some other multiway methods: PCAn (Tucker-n) and PARAFAC/CANDECOMP with these extensions.
