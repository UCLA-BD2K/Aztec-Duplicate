This package performs voxel-wise deconvolution analysis of DCE-MRI contrast agent concentration versus time data and generates the Impulse Response Function, which can be used to approximate commonly utilized kinetic parameters such as Ktrans and ve. An interactive advanced voxel diagnosis tool (AVDT) is also provided to facilitate easy navigation of voxel-wise data
