The R453Plus1Toolbox is an R/Bioconductor package for the analysis of 454 Sequencing data. Projects generated with Roche's data analysis software can be imported into R allowing advanced and customized analyses within the R/Bioconductor environment for sequencing data. Several methods were implemented extending the current functionality of Roche's software. These extensions include methods for quality assurance and annotation of detected variants. Further, a pipeline for the detection of structural variants, e.g. balanced chromosomal translocations, is provided. Availability: The R453Plus1Toolbox is implemented in R and available at http://www.bioconductor.org/. A vignette outlining typical workflows is included in the package.
