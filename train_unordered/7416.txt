High-throughput genome-wide studies of alternatively spliced mRNA transcripts have become increasingly important in clinical research. Consequently, easy-to-use software tools are required to process data from these studies, for example, using exon and junction arrays. Here, we introduce JETTA, an integrated software package for the calculation of gene expression indices as well as the identification and visualization of alternative splicing events. We demonstrate the software using data of human liver and muscle samples hybridized on an exonâ€“junction array. Availability: JETTA and its demonstrations are freely available at
