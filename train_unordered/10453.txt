We introduce PATH2PPI, a new R package to identify proteinâ€“protein interaction (PPI) networks for fully sequenced organisms for which nearly none PPI are known. PATH2PPI predicts PPI networks based on sets of proteins from well-established model organisms, providing an intuitive visualization and usability. It can be used to combine and transfer information of a certain pathway or biological process from several reference organisms to one target organism. Availability and implementation: PATH2PPI is an open-source tool implemented in R. It can be obtained from the Bioconductor project: http://bioconductor.org/packages/Path2PPI/
