Motivation: A common question arises at the beginning of every experiment where RNA-Seq is used to detect differential gene expression between two conditions: How many reads should we sequence? Results: Scotty is an interactive web-based application that assists biologists to design an experiment with an appropriate sample size and read depth to satisfy the user-defined experimental objectives.
