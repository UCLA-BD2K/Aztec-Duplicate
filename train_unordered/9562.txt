Motivation: This website allows the detection of horizontal transfers based on a combination of parametric methods and proposes an origin by researching neighbors in a bank of genomic signatures. This bank is also used to research an origin to DNA fragments from metagenomics studies. Results: Different services are provided like the possibility of inferring a phylogenetic tree with sequence signatures or comparing two genomes and displaying the rearrangements that happened since their separation.
