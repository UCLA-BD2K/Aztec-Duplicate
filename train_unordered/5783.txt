DWV is a web DICOM viewer in pure Javascript and HTML5. It can be used on any modern browser without any downloads or plugins. It does not require a file system and works on computers, mobile devices and internet-capable TVs. DWV can be incorporated into a PACS server that supports the WADO protocol, allowing web-based searching and viewing of DICOM studies, and can also be launched through a URL based on such a server. Depending on browser support, DWV can also load images from a local filesystem.
