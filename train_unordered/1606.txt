This is a Hi-C analysis package using a cumulative binomial test to detect interactions between distal genomic loci that have significantly more reads than expected by chance in Hi-C experiments. It takes mapped paired NGS reads as input and gives back the list of significant interactions for a given bin size in the genome.
