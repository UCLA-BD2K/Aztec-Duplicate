This package provides a pipeline for analysis of GC-MS data acquired in selected ion monitoring (SIM) mode. The tool also provides a guidance in choosing appropriate fragments for the targets of interest by using an optimization algorithm. This is done by considering overlapping peaks from a provided library by the user.
