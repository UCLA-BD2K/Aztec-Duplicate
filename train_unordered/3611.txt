cWords is a method used for identification of over-represented words in a set of ranked sequences. By default it is aimed at human miRNA analysis; you give a ranked list of differential expression values of genes across two conditions and it finds words in 3' UTRs of lengths 6 and 7 over-represented in the most regulated genes.
