Motivation: Validation and reproducibility of results is a central and pressing issue in genomics. Several recent embarrassing incidents involving the irreproducibility of high-profile studies have illustrated the importance of this issue and the need for rigorous methods for the assessment of reproducibility. Results: Here, we describe an existing statistical model that is very well suited to this problem. We explain its utility for assessing the reproducibility of validation experiments, and apply it to a genome-scale study of adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR)-mediated RNA editing in Drosophila. We also introduce a statistical method for planning validation experiments that will obtain the tightest reproduci-bility confidence limits, which, for a fixed total number of experiments, returns the optimal number of replicates for the study. Availability: Downloadable software and a web service for both the analysis of data from a reproducibility study and for the optimal design of these studies is provided at
