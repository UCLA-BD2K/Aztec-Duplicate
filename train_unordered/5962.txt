This package computes the correlation matrix for each scale of a wavelet decomposition, namely the one performed by the R package waveslim (Whitcher, 2000). An hypothesis test is applied to each entry of one matrix in order to construct an adjacency matrix of a graph. The graph obtained is finally analysed using the small-world theory (Watts and Strogatz, 1998) and using the computation of efficiency (Latora, 2001), tested using simulated attacks. The brainwaver project is complementary to the camba project for brain-data preprocessing. A collection of scripts (with a makefile) is avalaible to download along with the brainwaver package, see information on the webpage mentioned below.
