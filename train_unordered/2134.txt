Large data files can be difficult to work with in R, where data generally resides in memory. This package encourages a style of programming where data is 'streamed' from disk into R via a `producer' and through a series of `consumers' that, typically reduce the original data to a manageable size. The package provides useful Producer and Consumer stream components for operations such as data input, sampling, indexing, and transformation; see package?Streamer for details.
