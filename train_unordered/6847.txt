Motivation: An autoimmune disorder occurs when the immune system mistakenly attacks and destroys its own healthy body tissues. The initiation of a geoepidemiological database, for recording autoim-mune incidents with a focus to clinical manifestations, demographic parameters and geographic background is crucial to detect correlations. Results: The dAUTObase collects an ever increasing number of pub-lications—currently counting 435—on autoimmune diseases' frequencies in various populations and ethnic groups. The respective data have been hosted by a web application developed for the task. It uses three data visualization tools: the PivotViewer, the Disease Treemap and the Disease World Map, to assist the effective data querying. Availability and implementation: The dAUTObase 2.0 version (www. biodata.gr/dautobase) needs no registration for querying, but data entry and modification is reserved for registered users (curators-administrators).
