Features: 1) Assess overall DNA-binding signals in the data and select appropriate quality of tag alignment, 2) Discard or restrict positions with abnormally high number of tabs, 3) Calculate genome-wide profiles of smoothed tag density and save them in WIG files for viewing in other browsers including the information provided including conservative statistical estimates of fold enrichment ratios along the genome, and 4) Determine statistically significant point binding positions.
