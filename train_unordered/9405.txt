Constraint network analysis (CNA) is a graph theory-based rigidity analysis approach for linking a biomolecule's structure, flexibility, (thermo)stability and function. Results from CNA are highly information-rich and require intuitive, synchronized and interactive visualization for a comprehensive analysis. We developed VisualCNA, an easy-to-use PyMOL plug-in that allows setup of CNA runs and analysis of CNA results linking plots with molecular graphics representations. From a practical viewpoint, the most striking feature of VisualCNA is that it facilitates interactive protein engineering aimed at improving thermostability. Availability and Implementation: VisualCNA and its dependencies (CNA and FIRST software) are available free of charge under GPL and academic licenses, respectively. VisualCNA and CNA are available at
