Motivation: The most common RNA-Seq strategy consists of random shearing, amplification and high-throughput sequencing of the RNA fraction. Methods to analyze transcription level variations along the genome from the read count profiles generated by the RNA-Seq protocol are needed. Results: We developed a statistical approach to estimate the local transcription levels and to identify transcript borders. This transcrip-tional landscape reconstruction relies on a state-space model to describe transcription level variations in terms of abrupt shifts and more progressive drifts. A new emission model is introduced to capture not only the read count variance inside a transcript but also its short-range autocorrelation and the fraction of positions with zero counts. The estimation relies on a particle Gibbs algorithm whose running time makes it more suited to microbial genomes. The approach outper-formed read-overlapping strategies on synthetic and real microbial datasets.
