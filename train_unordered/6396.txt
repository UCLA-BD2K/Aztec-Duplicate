SHAP (simple high-throughput annotation pipeline) is a lightweight and scalable sequence annotation pipeline capable of supporting research efforts that generate or utilize large volumes of DNA sequence data. The software provides Grid capable analysis, relational storage and Web-based full-text searching of annotation results. Implemented in Java, SHAP recognizes the limited resources of many smaller research groups. Availability: Source code is freely available under GPLv3 at https://sourceforge.net/projects/
