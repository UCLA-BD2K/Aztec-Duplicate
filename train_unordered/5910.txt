The goals of Omics Pipe are to provide researchers with an open-source computational solution to implement ‘best practice’ pipelines with minimal development overhead and providing visual outputs to aid the researcher in biological interpretation. Currently Omics Pipe automates and provides summary reports for two RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) pipelines, variant calling from whole exome sequencing (WES) and whole genome sequencing (WGS) based on the Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK), two ChIP-seq pipelines and a custom RNA-seq pipeline for personalized cancer genomic medicine reporting.
