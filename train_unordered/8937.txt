Visualizing and summarizing data from genomic studies continues to be a challenge. Here, we introduce the GenVisR package to addresses this challenge by providing highly customiz-able, publication-quality graphics focused on cohort level genome analyses. GenVisR provides a rapid and easy-to-use suite of genomic visualization tools, while maintaining a high degree of flexibility by leveraging the abilities of ggplot2 and Bioconductor.
