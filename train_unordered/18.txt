MapMi is a tool for mapping and analysis of miRNA sequences. It is designed to locate miRNA precursor sequences in existing genomic sequences (e.g Ensembl and Ensembl Metazoa), using potential mature miRNA sequences as input. After searching the genome for the provided mature sequences, these hits are extended and classified taking into account major structural properties of known miRNA precursors.
