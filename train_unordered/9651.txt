Motivation: Much is now known about the mechanistic details of gene translation. There are also rapid advances in high-throughput technologies to determine quantitative aspects of the system. As a consequence-realistic and system-wide simulation models of translation are now feasible. Such models are also needed as devices to integrate a large volume of highly fragmented data known about translation.
