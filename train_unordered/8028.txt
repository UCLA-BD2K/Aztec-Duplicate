BioJS is an open-source project whose main objective is the visualization of biological data in JavaScript. BioJS provides an easy-to-use consistent framework for bioinformatics application programmers. It follows a community-driven standard specification that includes a collection of components purposely designed to require a very simple configuration and installation. In addition to the programming framework, BioJS provides a centralized repository of components available for reutilization by the bioinformatics community. Availability and implementation:
