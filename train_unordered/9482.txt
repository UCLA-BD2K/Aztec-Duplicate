HapFlow is a python application for visualizing haplotypes present in sequencing data. It identifies variant profiles present and reads and creates an abstract visual representation of these profiles to make haplotypes easier to identify. Availability and implementation: HapFlow is freely available (under a GPL license) for download (for Mac OS X, Unix and Microsoft Windows) from github
