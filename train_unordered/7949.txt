MSnbase is an R/Bioconductor package for the analysis of quantitative proteomics experiments that use isobaric tagging. It provides an exploratory data analysis framework for reproducible research, allowing raw data import, quality control, visualization, data processing and quantitation. MSnbase allows direct integration of quantitative proteomics data with additional facilities for statistical analysis provided by the Bioconductor project. Availability: MSnbase is implemented in R (version â‰¥2.13.0) and available at the Bioconductor web site (http://www.bioconductor .org/). Vignettes outlining typical workflows, input/output capabilities and detailing underlying infrastructure are included in the package.
