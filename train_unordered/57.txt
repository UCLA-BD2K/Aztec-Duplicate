Kazusa Molecular Formula Searcher (MFSearcher) is a RESTful web service for high-throughput prediction of elemental compositions from accurate mass values detected by high-resolution mass spectrometers. Immediate search to the major compound databases, KEGG, PubChem, KNApSAcK, LIPID MAPS, Flavonoid Viewer, HMDB is also available. MFSearcher will contribute to accelerate metabolite annotations and development of annotation tools in metabolomic studies based on mass spectrometers.
