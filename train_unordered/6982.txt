The DOMIRE web server implements a novel, automatic, protein structural domain assignment procedure based on 3D substructures of the query protein which are also found within structures of a non-redundant protein database. These common 3D substructures are transformed into a co-occurrence matrix that offers a global view of the protein domain organization. Three different algorithms are employed to define structural domain boundaries from this co-occurrence matrix. For each query, a list of structural neighbors and their alignments are provided. DOMIRE, by displaying the protein structural domain organization, can be a useful tool for defining protein common cores and for unravelling the evolutionary relationship between different proteins.
