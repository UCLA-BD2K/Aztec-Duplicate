The package implements a method for normalising microarray intensities, both between colours within array, and between arrays. The method uses a robust variant of the maximum-likelihood estimator for the stochastic model of microarray data described in the references (see vignette). The model incorporates data calibration (a.k.a. normalization), a model for the dependence of the variance on the mean intensity, and a variance stabilizing data transformation. Differences between transformed intensities are analogous to "normalized log-ratios". However, in contrast to the latter, their variance is independent of the mean, and they are usually more sensitive and specific in detecting differential transcription.
