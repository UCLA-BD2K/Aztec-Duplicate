GenAlEx: Genetic Analysis in Excel is a cross-platform package for population genetic analyses that runs within Microsoft Excel. GenAlEx offers analysis of diploid codominant, haploid and binary genetic loci and DNA sequences. Both frequency-based (F-statistics, heterozygosity, HWE, population assignment, related-ness) and distance-based (AMOVA, PCoA, Mantel tests, multivariate spatial autocorrelation) analyses are provided. New features include calculation of new estimators of population structure: G 0 ST , G 00 ST , Jost's D est and F 0 ST through AMOVA, Shannon Information analysis, linkage disequilibrium analysis for biallelic data and novel heterogen-eity tests for spatial autocorrelation analysis. Export to more than 30 other data formats is provided. Teaching tutorials and expanded step-by-step output options are included. The comprehensive guide has been fully revised. Availability and implementation: GenAlEx is written in VBA and provided as a Microsoft Excel
