We present Voroprot, an interactive cross-platform software tool that provides a unique set of capabilities for exploring geometric features of protein structure. Voroprot allows the construction and visualization of the Apollonius diagram (also known as the additively weighted Voronoi diagram), the Apollonius graph, protein alpha shapes, interatomic contact surfaces, solvent accessible surfaces, pockets and cavities inside protein structure. Availability: Voroprot is available for Windows, Linux and Mac OS X operating systems and can be downloaded from
