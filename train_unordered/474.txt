The FASTA (pronounced FAST-Aye) suite of programs includes three specialist programs for searching databases with a set of sequence fragments, as may be obtained from protein mass spec. or Edman protein sequencing:
* FASTF - Compares an ordered peptide mixture, as would be obtained by Edman degradation of a CNBr cleavage of a protein, against a protein database.
* FASTM - Compares an ordered set of peptides to a protein sequence database or an ordered set of oligonucleotides to a nucleotide sequence database.
* FASTS - Compares a set of short peptide fragments, as would be obtained from mass-spec. analysis of a protein, against a protein database.
