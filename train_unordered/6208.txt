Motivation: In the field of glycomics research, several different techniques are used for structure elucidation. Although multiple techniques are often used to increase confidence in structure assignments, most glycomics databases allow storing of only a single type of experimental data. In addition, the methods used to prepare a sample for analysis is seldom recorded making it harder to reproduce the analytical data and results. Results: We have extended the freely available EUROCarbDB framework to allow the submission of experimental data and the reporting of several orthogonal experimental datasets. The features aim to increase the understandability and reproducibility of the reported data. Availability and implementation: The installation with the glycan standards is available at
