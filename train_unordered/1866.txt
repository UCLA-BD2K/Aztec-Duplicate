PAA imports single color (protein) microarray data that has been saved in gpr file format - esp. ProtoArray data. After pre-processing (background correction, batch filtering, normalization) univariate feature pre-selection is performed (e.g., using the "minimum M statistic" approach - hereinafter referred to as "mMs"). Subsequently, a multivariate feature selection is conducted to discover biomarker candidates. Therefore, either a frequency-based backwards elimination aproach or ensemble feature selection can be used. PAA provides a complete toolbox of analysis tools including several different plots for results examination and evaluation.
