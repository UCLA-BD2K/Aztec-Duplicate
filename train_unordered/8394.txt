The Macrophage Pathway Knowledgebase (MACPAK) is a computational system that allows biomedical researchers to query and study the dynamic behaviors of macrophage molecular pathways. It integrates the knowledge of 230 reviews that were carefully checked by specialists for their accuracy and then converted to 230 dynamic mathematical pathway models. MACPAK comprises a total of 24 009 entities and 12 774 processes and is described in the Cell System Markup Language (CSML), an XML format that runs on the Cell Illustrator platform and can be visualized with a customized Cytoscape for further analysis. Availability: MACPAK can be accessed via an interactive web site at http://macpak.csml.org. The CSML pathway models are available under the Creative Commons license.
