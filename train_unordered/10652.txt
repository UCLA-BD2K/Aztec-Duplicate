We describe mod_bio, a set of modules for the Apache HTTP server that allows the users to access and query fastq, tabix, fasta and bam files through a Web browser. Those data are made available in plain text, HTML, XML, JSON and JSON-P. A javascript-based genome browser using the JSON-P communication technique is provided as an example of cross-domain Web service. Availability and implementation: https://github.com/lindenb/mod_ bio.
