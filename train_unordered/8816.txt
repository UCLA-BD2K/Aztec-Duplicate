MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been extensively studied owing to their important regulatory roles in genic expression. An increasingly number of reports are performing extensive data mining in small RNA sequencing libraries to detect miRNAs isoforms and also 5 0 and 3 0 post-transcriptional nucleotide additions, as well as edited miRNAs sequences. A ready to use pipeline, isomiRID, was developed to standardize and automatize the search for miRNAs isoforms in high-throughput small RNA sequencing libraries. Availability: isomiRID is a command line Python script available at
