The package contains tools for the analysis of diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging data (dMRI). It can be used to read dMRI data, to estimate the diffusion tensor, for the adaptive smoothing of dMRI data, the estimation of orientation density functions or its square root, the estimation of tensor mixture models, the estimation of the diffusion kurtosis model, fiber tracking, and for the two- and three-dimensional visualization of the results.
