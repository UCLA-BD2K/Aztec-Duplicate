We present an improved version of our Protein Peeling web server dedicated to the analysis of protein structure architecture through the identification of protein units produced by an iterative splitting algorithm. New features include identification of structural domains, detection of unstructured terminal elements and evaluation of the stability of protein unit structures. Availability: The website is free and open to all users with no login requirements at http://www.dsimb.inserm.fr/dsimb-tools/
