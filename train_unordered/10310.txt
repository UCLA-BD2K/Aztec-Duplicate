Motivation: In searching for genetic variants for complex diseases with deep sequencing data, genomic marker sets of high-dimensional genotypic data and sparse functional variants are quite common. Existing sequence association tests are incapable of identifying such marker sets or individual causal loci, although they appeared powerful to identify small marker sets with dense functional variants. In sequence association studies of admixed individuals, cryptic relatedness and population structure are known to confound the association analyses. Method: We here propose a unified marker wise test (uFineMap) to accurately localize causal loci and a unified high-dimensional set based test (uHDSet) to identify high-dimensional sparse associations in deep sequencing genomic data of multi-ethnic individuals with random relatedness. These two novel tests are based on scaled sparse linear mixed regressions with L p (0 methods. We illustrated their practical utilities by the applications to DNA sequence data of Framingham Heart Study for osteoporosis. The proposed tests identified 11 novel significant genes that were missed by the prominent famSKAT and GEMMA. In particular, four out of six most significant pathways identified by the uHDSet but missed by famSKAT have been reported to be related to BMD or osteoporosis in the literature.
