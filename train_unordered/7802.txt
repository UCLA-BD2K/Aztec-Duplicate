We have created a new server FoldHandedness. Using this server it is possible: (i) to define the regions of helices from two issues (from the PDB file and using the last version of the DSSP program), (ii) to determine the handedness for any chosen three helices and (iii) to calculate the angle and sign between the chosen pairs of the helices for large proteins and complexes of proteins with DNA or RNA.
