OncoRep is a fully automated RNA-Seq based report for patients with (breast) cancer, which includes molecular classification, detection of altered genes, detection of altered pathways, identification of gene fusion events, identification of clinical actionable mutations (in coding regions) and identification of treatable target structures. Furthermore, OncoRep reports suitable drugs based on identified actionable targets, which can be considered in the treatment decision making process.
