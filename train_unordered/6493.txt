CytoSaddleSum provides Cytoscape users with access to the functionality of SaddleSum, a functional enrichment tool based on sum-of-weight scores. It operates by querying SaddleSum locally (using the standalone version) or remotely (through an HTTP request to a web server). The functional enrichment results are shown as a term relationship network, where nodes represent terms and edges show term relationships. Furthermore, query results are written as Cytoscape attributes allowing easy saving, retrieval and integration into network-based data analysis workflows.
