Motivation: With the accumulation of genome-wide binding data for many transcription factors (TFs) in the same cell type or cellular condition , it is of great current interest to systematically infer the complex regulatory logic among multiple TFs. In particular, ChIP-Seq data have been generated for 14 core TFs critical to the maintenance and reprogramming of mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs). This provides a great opportunity to study the regulatory collaboration and interaction among these TFs and with other unknown co-regulators. Results: In combination with liquid association among gene expression profiles, we develop a computational method to predict context-dependent (CD) co-egulators of these core TFs in ESCs from pairwise binding datasets. That is, co-occupancy between a core TF and a predicted co-regulator depends on the presence or absence of binding sites of another core TF, which is regarded as a binding context. Unbiased external validation confirms that the predicted CD binding of a co-regulator is reliable. Our results reveal a detailed CD co-regulation network among the 14 core TFs and provide many other potential co-regulators showing strong agreement with the literature.
