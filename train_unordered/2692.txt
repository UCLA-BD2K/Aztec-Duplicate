The program TRITON is a graphic software package for in silico construction of protein mutants, for   modelling enzymatic reactions and for the analysis of essential interactions between the enzyme and its   substrate. It can also be used to dock ligand molecules into protein receptors. The protein mutants are constructed by homology modelling using the external program MODELLER while the   reactions are modelled using semi-empirical quantum-mechanic method of external program MOPAC. Docking   studies are performed using AutoDock software. The program TRITON provides graphic tools for the   preparation of the input data files, for running calculation and for the analysis of the output data.   Implementation ensures the overall integrity of consecutive steps of the modelling protein mutants and   evaluation of their properties. TRITON is suitable for molecular biologists and biochemists, non-  specialists in computer modelling.
