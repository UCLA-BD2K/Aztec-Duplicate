NFG is a collection of command-line tools that enable the generation of numerical fibre structures with a range of complexities spanning the levels expected of human white matter. Also included is a tool to simulate the diffusion-weighted MR (DW-MR) images that would arise from these structures under various imaging conditions. The primary use of the 'Numerical Fibre Generator' is to enable the testing of white-matter fibre tracking techniques based on DW-MRI.
