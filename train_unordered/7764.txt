The intergenic regions of the ambisense RNA segments of viruses from the Tospovirus genus form large extended RNA structures that regulate virus replication. Using comparative structure analysis , we show the presence of conserved alternative conformations at the apical parts of these structures. In one conformation, a branched Y-shape, the 5 0-proximal hairpin arms are mostly capped by exceptionally stable tetraloop motifs. The tetraloop hairpins are folded in both virus and virus-complementary sense RNAs, and different tetra-loops can functionally replace each other. Folding simulations show that the branched Y-shape structures can undergo a conformational transition to alternative extended rod-like conformations. Functional importance of both alternatives is supported by nucleotide covari-ations. The balanced equilibrium between alternative structures is evi-denced by native gel electrophoresis of mutant RNA transcripts with shifted equilibria. The tetraloops play a role in the stability and dynamics of structures but may also be recognized by proteins involved in translation and/or replication.
