We present BioBlend, a unified API in a high-level language (python) that wraps the functionality of Galaxy and CloudMan APIs. BioBlend makes it easy for bioinformaticians to automate end-to-end large data analysis, from scratch, in a way that is highly accessible to collaborators, by allowing them to both provide the required infrastructure and automate complex analyses over large datasets within the familiar Galaxy environment. Availability and implementation: http://bioblend.readthedocs.org/.
