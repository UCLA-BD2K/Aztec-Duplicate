Gene coexpression analysis was developed to explore gene interconnection at the expression level from a systems perspective, and differential coexpression analysis (DCEA), which examines the change in gene expression correlation between two conditions, was accordingly designed as a complementary technique to traditional differential expression analysis (DEA). Since there is a shortage of DCEA tools, we implemented in an R package 'DCGL' five DCEA methods for identification of differentially coexpressed genes and differentially coexpressed links, including three currently popular methods and two novel algorithms described in a companion paper. DCGL can serve as an easy-to-use tool to facilitate differential coexpression analyses. Contact: yyli@scbit.org and yxli@scbit.org
