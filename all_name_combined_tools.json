SeqGSEA accounts for biological variability and determines the statistical significance of gene pathways and networks using subject permutation, and thus requires at least five samples per group.

A rich scripting language and a well-developed web API allow easy customization of the user interface. Features include interactive animation and linear morphing. Jmol interfaces well with JSpecView for spectroscopy, JSME for 2D->3D conversion, POV-Ray for images, and CAD programs for 3D printing (VRML export).","repo":"sourceforge","description":"Motivation: In recent years, much structural information on protein domains and their pair-wise interactions has been made available in public databases. However, it is not yet clear how best to use this information to discover general rules or interaction patterns about structural proteinâ\u0080\u0093protein interactions. Improving our ability to detect and exploit structural interaction patterns will help to provide a better 3D picture of the known protein interactome, and will help to guide docking-based predictions of the 3D structures of unsolved protein complexes. Results: This article presents KBDOCK, a 3D database approach for spatially clustering protein binding sites and for performing template-based (knowledge-based) protein docking. KBDOCK combines residue contact information from the 3DID database with the Pfam protein domain family classification together with coordinate data from the Protein Data Bank. This allows the 3D configurations of all known hetero domainâ\u0080\u0093domain interactions to be superposed and clustered for each Pfam family. We find that most Pfam domain families have up to four hetero binding sites, and over 60% of all domain families have just one hetero binding site. The utility of this approach for template-based docking is demonstrated using 73 complexes from the Protein Docking Benchmark. Overall, up to 45 out of 73 complexes may be modelled by direct homology to existing domain interfaces, and key binding site information is found for 24 of the 28 remaining complexes. These results show that KBDOCK can often provide useful information for predicting the structures of unknown protein complexes.","language":["JavaScript"],"source":"Grobid Extraction:

Here, we present and evaluate BCFtools\/RoH, an extension to the BCFtools software package, that detects regions of autozygosity in sequencing data, in particular exome data, using a hidden Markov model. By applying it to simulated data and real data from the 1000 Genomes Project we estimate its accuracy and show that it has higher sensitivity and specificity than existing methods under a range of sequencing error rates and levels of autozygosity.\n        Availability and implementation: BCFtools\/RoH and its associated binary\/source files are freely available from https:\/\/github.com\/samtools\/BCFtools.\n        Contact:\nvn2@sanger.ac.uk or pd3@sanger.ac.uk\n        Supplementary information:\nSupplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.","language":["C"],"source":"PMC Extraction","repoUpdatedDate":Thu Jul 06 15:47:15 PDT 2017,"repoHomepage":"http:\/\/samtools.github.io\/bcftools\/","platforms":["Web UI","Linux, Unix"],"linkDescriptions":null,"emails":["vn2@sanger.ac.uk or","pd3@sanger.ac.uk"],"linkUrls":["https:\/\/github.com\/samtools\/BCFtools","https:\/\/toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu\/repository?repository_id=a710eeafab5237fa","https:\/\/toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu\/repository?repository_id=22b76e5a3f9b3c77"],"publicationReferences":[8],"dateCreated":Thu Jul 06 10:44:38 PDT 2017,"repoCreationDate":Fri Jul 12 05:55:22 PDT 2013,"id":10979,"publicationDate":["2016-01-30T00:00:00Z"],"repoForks":83,"codeRepoURL":"github.com\/samtools\/BCFtools","types":["Tool"],"repoOwner":"samtools","repoName":"bcftools","suggestName":"bcftools","publicationPMID":[26826718],"domains":["Statistics and Probability","Computational Theory and Mathematics","Biochemistry","Molecular Biology","Computational Mathematics","Computer Science Applications","Genomics"],"publicationTitle":["BCFtools\/RoH: a hidden Markov model approach for detecting autozygosity from next-generation sequencing data."],"publicationDOI":["10.1093\/bioinformatics\/btw044"],"dateUpdated":Thu Jul 06 10:44:38 PDT 2017,"tags":["Variant Analysis","Sequence Analysis","Statistics"],"institutions":["Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute","University of Cambridge"],"publicationJournal":["Bioinformatics"],"license":"No License","_version_":1572223141951832064,"name":"bcftools","suggestNamePrefix":"bcftools","authorEmails":null,"authors":["Vagheesh V Narasimhan","Petr P Danecek","Aylwyn A Scally","Yali Y Xue","Chris C Tyler-Smith","Richard R Durbin","iuc","nilesh"]},{"types":["Tool"],"suggestName":"DbClustal (REST)","domains":["Proteomics"],"description":"DbClustal is a ClustalW based alignment workflow for sequences identified by a protein BLAST (NCBI BLAST or WU-BLAST) search.

The former is computationally slow and has difficulty to identify clusters of irregular shapes. The latter approach cannot be applied directly to high-dimensional data as the computational time and memory become unmanageable and the estimated histogram is unreliable. An algorithm without these two problems would be very useful.\n        Results: In this article, we combine ideas from the finite mixture model and histogram spatial exploration. This new algorithm, which we call flowPeaks, can be applied directly to high-dimensional data and identify irregular shape clusters. The algorithm first uses K-means algorithm with a large K to partition the cell population into many small clusters. These partitioned data allow the generation of a smoothed density function using the finite mixture model. All local peaks are exhaustively searched by exploring the density function and the cells are clustered by the associated local peak. The algorithm flowPeaks is automatic, fast and reliable and robust to cluster shape and outliers. This algorithm has been applied to flow cytometry data and it has been compared with state of the art algorithms, including Misty Mountain, FLOCK, flowMeans, flowMerge and FLAME.\n        Availability: The R package flowPeaks is available at https:\/\/github.com\/yongchao\/flowPeaks.\n        Contact:\nyongchao.ge@mssm.edu\n        Supplementary information:\nSupplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online","language":["R"],"source":"PMC Extraction","repoUpdatedDate":Fri Mar 10 01:00:18 PST 2017,"repoHomepage":"","platforms":["Linux (Unix)","Windows 32","Windows 64","Mac OS X 10.6","Mac OS X 10.9"],"linkDescriptions":null,"emails":["yongchao.ge@mssm.edu"],"linkUrls":["https:\/\/github.com\/yongchao\/flowPeaks","http:\/\/bioconductor.org\/packages\/release\/bioc\/html\/flowPeaks.html","http:\/\/bioconductor.org\/packages\/release\/bioc\/vignettes\/flowPeaks\/inst\/doc\/flowPeaks-guide.pdf","http:\/\/bioconductor.org\/packages\/release\/bioc\/src\/contrib\/flowPeaks_1.10.0.tar.gz"],"publicationReferences":[21],"dateCreated":Thu Jul 06 10:51:15 PDT 2017,"repoCreationDate":Thu Mar 15 13:07:56 PDT 2012,"suggestTag":["Data and Text Mining"],"suggestTagPrefix":["Data and Text Mining"],"id":10989,"publicationDate":["2012-05-17T00:00:00Z"],"repoForks":1,"codeRepoURL":"github.com\/yongchao\/flowPeaks","funding":["HHS: HHSN 266200500021C","PHS: HHSN 266200500021C"],"types":["Tool"],"repoOwner":"yongchao","repoName":"flowPeaks","suggestName":"flowPeaks","publicationPMID":[22595209],"domains":["Statistics and Probability","Computational Theory and Mathematics","Biochemistry","Molecular Biology","Computational Mathematics","Computer Science Applications"],"publicationTitle":["flowPeaks: a fast unsupervised clustering for flow cytometry data via K-means and density peak finding."],"publicationDOI":["10.1093\/bioinformatics\/bts300"],"dateUpdated":Fri Jul 07 02:15:07 PDT 2017,"tags":["Data and Text Mining","FlowCytometry","Clustering","Gating"],"institutions":["Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"],"publicationJournal":["Bioinformatics"],"license":"No License","_version_":1572223397908185088,"name":"flowPeaks","suggestNamePrefix":"flowPeaks","authorEmails":null,"authors":["Yongchao Y Ge","Stuart C SC Sealfon","Yongchao Ge<yongchao.ge@gmail.com"]},{"types":["Tool"],"suggestName":"package_freetype_2_5_2","description":"Downloads and compiles version 2.5.2 of the FreeType libraries.","source":"Galaxy","platforms":["Web UI","Linux, Unix"],"tags":["Tool Dependency Packages"],"dateUpdated":Mon Nov 09 21:01:48 PST 2015,"linkDescriptions":null,"linkUrls":["https:\/\/toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu\/repository?repository_id=c0c19dbc390ae199","https:\/\/toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu\/repository?repository_id=9b36a267d0a07ece"],"dateCreated":Mon Nov 09 21:01:48 PST 2015,"suggestTag":["Tool Dependency Packages"],"suggestTagPrefix":["Tool Dependency Packages"],"_version_":1572284385342783488,"name":"package_freetype_2_5_2","suggestNamePrefix":"package_freetype_2_5_2","id":10990,"authorEmails":null,"authors":["devteam","boris"]},{"fundingAgencies":["MEXT"],"repoDescription":"SAM (Sequence Alignment\/Map) is a flexible generic format for storing nucleotide sequence alignment.

However, variant calling in low coverage regions is difficult due to sequence read errors and mapping errors. Hence, variant calling approaches that are robust to low coverage data are demanded. Results: We propose a new variant calling approach that considers pedigree information and haplotyping based on sequence reads spanning two or more heterozygous positions termed phase informative reads. In our approach, genotyping and haplotyping by the assignment of each read to a haplotype based on phase informative reads are simultaneously performed. Therefore, positions with low evidence for heterozygosity are rescued by phase informative reads, and such rescued positions contribute to haplotyping in a synergistic way. In addition, pedigree information supports more accurate haplotyping as well as genotyping, especially in low coverage regions. Although het-erozygous positions are useful for haplotyping, homozygous positions are not informative and weaken the information from heterozygous positions, as majority of positions are homozygous. Thus, we introduce latent variables that determine zygosity at each position to filter out homozygous positions for haplotyping. In performance evaluation with a parentâ\u0080\u0093offspring trio sequencing data, our approach outper-forms existing approaches in accuracy on the agreement with single nucleotide polymorphism array genotyping results. Also, performance analysis considering distance between variants showed that the use of phase informative reads is effective for accurate variant calling, and further performance improvement is expected with longer sequencing data.","language":["Perl"],"source":"Grobid Extraction: Bioinformatics","repoUpdatedDate":Tue Jun 20 21:58:03 PDT

However, datasets processed by AMDIS require extensive data correction, filtering and reshaping to create reliable datasets for further downstream analysis.

Furthermore, manual corrections increase the chance of human error and can introduce additional technical variability to the data. Thus, an automated pipeline for curating GC-MS data is urgently needed.

The length of the strings is from 25 to 1000, depending on the DNA sequencing technologies. However, many DNA assemblers using overlap graphs suffer from the need for too much time and space in constructing the graphs. It is nearly impossible for these DNA assemblers to handle the huge amount of data produced by the next-generation sequencing technologies where the number n of strings could be several billions. If the overlap graph is explicitly stored, it would require (n 2) memory, which could be prohibitive in practice when n is greater than a hundred million. In this article, we propose a novel data structure using which the overlap graph can be compactly stored. This data structure requires only linear time to construct and and linear memory to store. Results: For a given set of input strings (also called reads), we can informally define an exact-match overlap graph as follows. Each read is represented as a node in the graph and there is an edge between two nodes if the corresponding reads overlap sufficiently. A formal description follows. The maximal exact-match overlap of two strings x and y, denoted by ov max (x,y), is the longest string which is a suffix of x and a prefix of y. The exact-match overlap graph of n given strings of length is an edge-weighted graph in which each vertex is associated with a string and there is an edge (x, y) of weight Ï\u0089 = â\u0088\u0092|ov max (x,y)| if and only if Ï\u0089 â\u0089¤ Î», where |ov max (x,y)| is the length of ov max (x,y) and Î» is a given threshold. In this article, we show that the exact-match overlap graphs can be represented by a compact data structure that can be stored using at most (2Î»â\u0088\u00921)(2logn++logÎ»)n bits with a guarantee that the basic operation of accessing an edge takes O(logÎ») time. We also propose two algorithms for constructing the data structure for the exact-match overlap graph. The first algorithm runs in O(Î»Î»nlogn) worse-case time and requires O(Î») extra memory. The second one runs in O(Î»Î»n) time and requires O(n) extra memory. Our experimental results on a huge amount of simulated data from sequence assembly show that the data structure can be constructed efficiently in time and memory.

Tested on 207 ENCODE ChIP-seq datasets, our method identifies correct motifs in 78% of the datasets with known motifs, demonstrating improvement in both accuracy and efficiency compared with DREME, another state-of-art discriminative motif discovery tool. More interestingly, on the remaining more challenging datasets, we identify common technical or biological factors that compromise the motif search results and use advanced features of our tool to control for these factors.

Sequential Window Acquisition of all Theoretical Spectra (SWATH) and Data Independent Acquisition (DIA) methods increase reproducibility of acquired data because the classical precursor selection is omitted and all present precursors are fragmented. However, especially for targeted data extraction, MS coordinates (retention time information precursor and fragment masses) are required for the particular entities (peptide ions). These coordinates are usually generated in a so-called discovery experiment earlier on in the project if not available in public spectral library repositories. The quality of the assay panel is crucial to ensure appropriate downstream analysis. For that, a method is needed to create spectral libraries and to export customizable assay panels. Results: Here, we present a versatile set of functions to generate assay panels from spectral libraries for use in targeted data extraction methods (SWATH\/DIA) in the area of proteomics.

Specifically, DNAA is able to find structural variation, SNP and indel variants, as well as evaluating the mapping and data quality. ","repo":"sourceforge","description":"Motivation: Recent studies have revealed the importance of considering quality scores of reads generated by next-generation sequence (NGS) platforms in various downstream analyses. It is also known that probabilistic alignments based on marginal probabilities (e.g. aligned-column and\/or gap probabilities) provide more accurate alignment than conventional maximum score-based alignment. There exists, however, no study about probabilistic alignment that considers quality scores explicitly, although the method is expected to be useful in SNP\/indel callers and bisulfite mapping, because accurate estimation of aligned columns or gaps is important in those analyses. Results: In this study, we propose methods of probabilistic alignment that consider quality scores of (one of) the sequences as well as a usual score matrix. The method is based on posterior decoding techniques in which various marginal probabilities are computed from a probabilistic model of alignments with quality scores, and can arbitrarily trade-off sensitivity and positive predictive value (PPV) of prediction (aligned columns and gaps). The method is directly applicable to read mapping (alignment) toward accurate detection of SNPs and indels. Several computational experiments indicated that probabilistic alignments can estimate aligned columns and gaps accurately, compared with other mapping algorithms e.g. SHRiMP2, Stampy, BWA and Novoalign. The study also suggested that our approach yields favorable precision for SNP\/indel calling.","language":["C"],"source":"Grobid Extraction: Bioinformatics","repoHomepage":"http:\/\/dnaa.sourceforge.net","linkDescriptions":null,"linkUrls":["http:\/\/www.novocraft.com\/),SHRiMP2","http:\/\/sourceforge.net\/projects\/dnaa","http:\/\/www.broadinstitute.org\/gsa\/wiki\/index.php\/Base_quality_score_recalibration","http:\/\/bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org","http:\/\/last.cbrc.jp.Contact","http:\/\/last.cbrc.jp","http:\/\/www.well.ox.ac.uk\/projectstampy","http:\/\/www.pacificbiosciences.com","https:\/\/code.google.com\/p\/slidesortbpr\/.Contact"],"dateCreated":Wed Oct 05 22:45:18 PDT 2011,"suggestTag":["scoring","sequencers","mapping","maps","reads","bioinformatics","alignments"],"suggestTagPrefix":["scoring","sequencers","mapping","maps","reads","bioinformatics","alignments"],"repoCreationDate":Tue Sep 01 17:00:00 PDT 2009,"id":11029,"repoDownloads":0,"repoForks":0,"codeRepoURL":"sourceforge.net\/projects\/dnaa","repoOwner":"oiiio","repoName":"dnaa","suggestName":"dnaa","domains":["Metagenomics"],"publicationDOI":["10.1093\/bioinformatics\/btr537","10.1093\/bioinformatics\/btu360"],"tags":["scoring","sequencers","mapping","maps","reads","bioinformatics","alignments","genomics","methods"],"dateUpdated":Fri Jul 07 02:18:36 PDT 2017,"institutions":["Computational Biology Research Center National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST)","Computational Biology Research Center National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology","Immunology Frontier Research Center Osaka University"],"license":"GNU General Public License version 2.0 (GPLv2)","_version_":1572285044338196480,"name":"dnaa","suggestNamePrefix":"dnaa","authorEmails":null,"authors":["Michiaki Hamada","Edward Wijaya","Martin C Frith","Kiyoshi Asai","Kana Shimizu","John Hancock"]},{"types":["Tool","Database"],"suggestName":"PSICQUIC (HPIDb)","domains":["Proteomics"],"description":"Search the Host - Pathogen Interaction Database using a protein id","source":"BioCatalogue","platforms":["REST","REST API"],"tags":["Protein Interaction","Data Retrieval","Information retrieval","Protein interactions"],"dateUpdated":Mon Nov 09 21:01:59 PST 2015,"linkDescriptions":null,"institutions":["European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI)"],"linkUrls":["https:\/\/code.google.com\/p\/psicquic\/wiki\/Registry","https:\/\/www.biocatalogue.org\/services\/3623","http:\/\/www.ebi.ac.uk\/Tools\/webservices\/psicquic\/hpidb\/webservices"],"dateCreated":Mon Nov 09 21:01:59 PST 2015,"suggestTag":["Protein Interaction","Data Retrieval"],"suggestTagPrefix":["Protein Interaction","Data Retrieval"],"_version_":1572282544794107904,"name":"PSICQUIC (HPIDb)","suggestNamePrefix":"PSICQUIC (HPIDb)","id":11030},{"outputFiles":["Protein features"],"types":["Tool (analysis)"],"suggestName":"Phobius","domains":["Proteomics"],"description":"Phobius is a server for prediction of transmembrane topology and signal peptides from the amino acid sequence of a protein.","source":"elixir","inputFiles":["Protein sequence","FASTA"],"publicationDOI":["10.1093\/nar\/gkm256"],"platforms":["Web UI","Command line"],"tags":["Sequence sites, features and motifs","Sequence analysis","Membrane and  lipoproteins","Protein membrane regions","Protein signal peptides"],"dateUpdated":Mon Nov 09 21:01:32 PST 2015,"linkDescriptions":null,"institutions":["EMBL-EBI","Stockholm Bioinformatics Center"],"linkUrls":["http:\/\/www.ebi.ac.uk\/Tools\/pfa\/phobius\/","http:\/\/www.ebi.ac.uk\/about\/terms-of-use","http:\/\/phobius.binf.ku.dk\/instructions.html","http:\/\/phobius.binf.ku.dk\/"],"dateCreated":Mon Nov 09 21:01:32 PST 2015,"suggestTag":["Sequence analysis"],"suggestTagPrefix":["Sequence analysis"],"_version_":1572284368848683008,"name":"Phobius","suggestNamePrefix":"Phobius","id":11031,"authors":["Erik Sonnhammer","Web Production"]},{"outputFiles":["HTML"],"types":["Database"],"suggestName":"Ensembl","domains":["Genomics"],"description":"Ensembl is a joint project between EMBL - EBI and the Sanger Institute  to develop a software system which produces and maintains automatic annotation on selected eukaryotic genomes.

A detailed understanding of the control of gene expression at the level of messenger RNA translation is vital to elucidating a systems-level view of complex molecular programs in the cell. Establishing the degree to which such post-transcriptional regulation can mediate specific phenotypes is similarly critical to elucidating the molecular pathogenesis of diseases such as cancer. Recently, methods for massively parallel sequencing of ribosome-bound fragments of messenger RNA have begun to uncover genome-wide translational control at codon resolution. Despite its promise for deeply characterizing mammalian proteomes, few analytical methods exist for the comprehensive analysis of this paired RNA and ribosome data. Results: We describe the Babel framework, an analytical methodology for assessing the significance of changes in translational regulation within cells and between conditions. This approach facilitates the analysis of translation genome-wide while allowing statistically principled gene-level inference. Babel is based on an errors-in-variables regression model that uses the negative binomial distribution and draws inference using a parametric bootstrap approach. We demonstrate the operating characteristics of Babel on simulated data and use its gene-level inference to extend prior analyses significantly, discovering new translationally regulated modules under mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway signaling control.

The interest of the scientific community in identifying best approaches to develop such prediction models was reaffirmed in a competition style international collaboration called IMPROVER Diagnostic Signature Challenge whose results we describe herein.\n        Results: Fifty-four teams used public data to develop prediction models in four disease areas including multiple sclerosis, lung cancer, psoriasis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and made predictions on blinded new data that we generated. Teams were scored using three metrics that captured various aspects of the quality of predictions, and best performers were awarded. This article presents the challenge results and introduces to the community the approaches of the best overall three performers, as well as an R package that implements the approach of the best overall team.\n        The analyses of model performance data submitted in the challenge as well as additional simulations that we have performed revealed that (i) the quality of predictions depends more on the disease endpoint than on the particular approaches used in the challenge; (ii) the most important modeling factor (e.g. data preprocessing, feature selection and classifier type) is problem dependent; and (iii) for optimal results datasets and methods have to be carefully matched. Biomedical factors such as the disease severity and confidence in diagnostic were found to be associated with the misclassification rates across the different teams.\n        Availability: The lung cancer dataset is available from Gene Expression Omnibus (accession, GSE43580).

Available methods integrate the DNA methylation and gene expression data into a network by specifying the anti-correlation between them. However, the correlation between methylation and expression is usually unknown and difficult to determine. Results: To address this issue, we present a novel multiple network framework for epigenetic modules, namely, Epigenetic Module based on Differential Networks (EMDN) algorithm, by simultaneously analyzing DNA methylation and gene expression data. The EMDN algorithm prevents the specification of the correlation between methylation and expression. The accuracy of EMDN algorithm is more efficient than that of modern approaches. On the basis of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) breast cancer data, we observe that the EMDN algorithm can recognize positively and negatively correlated modules and these modules are significantly more enriched in the known pathways than those obtained by other algorithms. These modules can serve as bio-markers to predict breast cancer subtypes by using methylation profiles, where positively and negatively correlated modules are of equal importance in the classification of cancer subtypes. Epigenetic modules also estimate the survival time of patients, and this factor is critical for cancer therapy. Conclusions: The proposed model and algorithm provide an effective method for the integrative analysis of DNA methylation and gene expression.

It includes ENmix background correction, RELIC dye bias correction, RCP probe-type bias adjustment, along with a number of additional tools. These functions can be used to remove unwanted experimental noise and thus to improve accuracy and reproducibility of methylation measures. ENmix functions are flexible and transparent. Users have option to choose a single pipeline command to finish all data pre-processing steps (including background correction, dye-bias adjustment, inter-array normalization and probe-type bias correction) or to use individual functions sequentially to perform data pre-processing in a more customized manner. In addition the ENmix package has selectable complementary functions for efficient data visualization (such as data distribution plots); quality control (identifing and filtering low quality data points, samples, probes, and outliers, along with imputation of missing values); identification of probes with multimodal distributions due to SNPs or other factors; exploration of data variance structure using principal component regression analysis plot; preparation of experimental factors related surrogate control variables to be adjusted in downstream statistical analysis; and an efficient algorithm oxBS-MLE to estimate 5-methylcytosine and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine level.","repo":"bioconductor","description":"Motivation: The Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip has been extensively utilized in epigenome-wide association studies.

Ignoring the difference in distributions between the two probe types may bias downstream analysis. Results: Here, we developed a novel method, called Regression on Correlated Probes (RCP), which uses the existing correlation between pairs of nearby type I and II probes to adjust the beta values of all type II probes. We evaluate the effect of this adjustment on reducing probe design type bias, reducing technical variation in duplicate samples, improving accuracy of measurements against known standards, and retention of biological signal. We find that RCP is statistically significantly better than unadjusted data or adjustment with alternative methods including SWAN and BMIQ.

To distinguish the systematic changes in expression between conditions from noise, the counts are frequently modeled by the Negative Binomial distribution. However, in experiments with small sample size, the per-gene estimates of the dispersion parameter are unreliable.\n        Method: We propose a simple and effective approach for estimating the dispersions. First, we obtain the initial estimates for each gene using the method of moments. Second, the estimates are regularized, i.e. shrunk towards a common value that minimizes the average squared difference between the initial estimates and the shrinkage estimates. The approach does not require extra modeling assumptions, is easy to compute and is compatible with the exact test of differential expression.\n        Results: We evaluated the proposed approach using 10 simulated and experimental datasets and compared its performance with that of currently popular packages edgeR, DESeq, baySeq, BBSeq and SAMseq. For these datasets, sSeq performed favorably for experiments with small sample size in sensitivity, specificity and computational time.\n

Although highly accurate, resulting reads are short, making their analyses challenging. Recently, a new technology, single molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing, was developed that could address these challenges, as it generates reads of several thousand bases. But, their broad application has been hampered by a high error rate. Therefore, hybrid approaches that use high-quality short reads to correct erroneous SMRT long reads have been developed. Still, current implementations have great demands on hardware, work only in well-defined computing infrastructures and reject a substantial amount of reads. This limits their usability considerably, especially in the case of large sequencing projects. Results: Here we present proovread, a hybrid correction pipeline for SMRT reads, which can be flexibly adapted on existing hardware and infrastructurefrom a laptop to a high-performance computing cluster.On genomic and transcriptomic test cases covering Escherichia coli, Arabidopsis thaliana and human, proovread achieved accuracies up to 99.9% and outperformed the existing hybrid correction programs. Furthermore, proovread-corrected sequences were longer and the throughput was higher. Thus, proovread combines the most accurate correctionresultswithan excellentadaptabilitytotheavailablehardware. It will therefore increase the applicability and value of SMRT sequencing.

But often, especially in clinical settings, the cytometer cannot measure all the desired markers in a single aliquot. In these cases, tissue is separated into independently analysed samples, leaving a need to electronically recombine these to increase dimensionality. Nearest-neighbour (NN) based imputation fulfils this need but can produce artificial subpopulations. Clustering-based NNs can reduce these, but requires prior domain knowledge to be able to parameterize the clustering, so is unsuited to discovery settings.\n        Results: We present flowBin, a parameterization-free method for combining multitube FCM data into a higher-dimensional form suitable for deep profiling and discovery. FlowBin allocates cells to bins defined by the common markers across tubes in a multitube experiment, then computes aggregate expression for each bin within each tube, to create a matrix of expression of all markers assayed in each tube. We show, using simulated multitube data, that flowType analysis of flowBin output reproduces the results of that same analysis on the original data for cell types of >10% abundance.

As tests are performed on a large number of genes, stringent false-discovery rate control is required at the expense of detection power. Ad hoc filtering techniques are regularly used to moderate this correction by removing genes with low signal, with little attention paid to their impact on downstream analyses.\n        Results: We propose a data-driven method based on the Jaccard similarity index to calculate a filtering threshold for replicated RNA sequencing data. In comparisons with alternative data filters regularly used in practice, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method to correctly filter lowly expressed genes, leading to increased detection power for moderately to highly expressed genes. Interestingly, this data-driven threshold varies among experiments, highlighting the interest of the method proposed here.\n        Availability: The proposed filtering method is implemented in the R package HTSFilter available on Bioconductor.\n        Contact:\nandrea.rau@jouy.inra.fr\n        Supplementary information:\nSupplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.","language":["R"],"source":"PMC Extraction","repoUpdatedDate":Tue Nov 22 23:59:23 PST 2016,"repoHomepage":"","platforms":["Linux (Unix)","Windows 32","Windows 64","Mac OS X 10.6","Mac OS X 10.9"],"linkDescriptions":null,"emails":["andrea.rau@jouy.inra.fr"],"linkUrls":["http:\/\/bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org\/lookup\/suppl\/doi:10.1093\/bioinformatics\/btt350\/-\/DC1","http:\/\/bioconductor.org\/packages\/release\/bioc\/html\/HTSFilter.html","http:\/\/bioconductor.org\/packages\/release\/bioc\/src\/contrib\/HTSFilter_1.8.0.tar.gz","http:\/\/bioconductor.org\/packages\/release\/bioc\/vignettes\/HTSFilter\/inst\/doc\/HTSFilter.pdf"],"publicationReferences":[28],"dateCreated":Thu Jul 06 10:47:34 PDT 2017,"repoCreationDate":Fri Mar 27 07:02:35 PDT 2015,"suggestTag":["Gene Expression"],"suggestTagPrefix":["Gene Expression"],"id":11091,"repoDownloads":180,"publicationDate":["2013-07-02T00:00:00Z"],"repoForks":1,"codeRepoURL":"http:\/\/bioconductor.org\/packages\/release\/bioc\/html\/HTSFilter.html","funding":["French National Research Agency: Grant not found","ANR: Grant not found","Agence nationale de la recherche: Grant not found"],"types":["Tool"],"repoOwner":"Bioconductor-mirror","repoName":"HTSFilter","suggestName":"HTSFilter","publicationPMID":[23821648],"domains":["Statistics and Probability","Computational Theory and Mathematics","Biochemistry","Molecular Biology","Computational Mathematics","Computer Science Applications","Genomics"],"publicationTitle":["Data-based filtering for replicated high-throughput transcriptome sequencing experiments."],"publicationDOI":["10.1093\/bioinformatics\/btt350"],"dateUpdated":Fri Jul 07 02:10:49 PDT 2017,"tags":["Gene Expression","Sequencing","RNASeq","Preprocessing","DifferentialExpression","GeneExpression","Normalization"],"institutions":["AgroParisTech","Institut National de la Recherche Agronomique"],"publicationJournal":["Bioinformatics"],"license":"Artistic-2.0","_version_":1572223290872692736,"name":"HTSFilter","suggestNamePrefix":"HTSFilter","authorEmails":null,"authors":["Andrea A Rau","MÃ©lina M Gallopin","Gilles G Celeux","Florence F JaffrÃ©zic","Andrea Rau","Melina Gallopin","Gilles Celeux","Florence Jaffrezic"]},{"fundingAgencies":["NIH","NIAID","HHS"],"repoDescription":"Ergatis is a web-based utility that is used to create, run, and monitor reusable computational analysis pipelines.","repo":"sourceforge","description":"Motivation: The growth of sequence data has been accompanied by an increasing need to analyze data on distributed computer clusters.

Software is also needed to simplify data management and make large-scale bioinformatics analysis accessible and reproducible to a wide class of target users.\n        Results: We have developed a workflow management system named Ergatis that enables users to build, execute and monitor pipelines for computational analysis of genomics data. Ergatis contains preconfigured components and template pipelines for a number of common bioinformatics tasks such as prokaryotic genome annotation and genome comparisons. Outputs from many of these components can be loaded into a Chado relational database. Ergatis was designed to be accessible to a broad class of users and provides a user friendly, web-based interface.

For ongoing development since then, see http:\/\/github.com\/samtools\/samtools","repo":"sourceforge","description":"Motivation: The study of cancer genomes now routinely involves using next-generation sequencing technology (NGS) to profile tumours for single nucleotide variant (SNV) somatic mutations. However, surprisingly few published bioinformatics methods exist for the specific purpose of identifying somatic mutations from NGS data and existing tools are often inaccurate, yielding intolerably high false prediction rates. As such, the computational problem of accurately inferring somatic mutations from paired tumour\/normal NGS data remains an unsolved challenge. Results: We present the comparison of four standard supervised machine learning algorithms for the purpose of somatic SNV prediction in tumour\/normal NGS experiments. To evaluate these approaches (random forest, Bayesian additive regression tree, support vector machine and logistic regression), we constructed 106 features representing 3369 candidate somatic SNVs from 48 breast cancer genomes, originally predicted with naive methods and subsequently revalidated to establish ground truth labels. We trained the classifiers on this data (consisting of 1015 true somatic mutations and 2354 non-somatic mutation positions) and conducted a rigorous evaluation of these methods using a cross-validation framework and hold-out test NGS data from both exome capture and whole genome shotgun platforms. All learning algorithms employing predictive discriminative approaches with feature selection improved the predictive accuracy over standard approaches by statistically significant margins. In addition, using unsupervised clustering of the ground truth 'false positive' predictions, we noted several distinct classes and present evidence suggesting non-overlapping sources of technical artefacts illuminating important directions for future study.

For ongoing development since then, see http:\/\/github.com\/samtools\/samtools","repo":"sourceforge","description":"Motivation: The study of cancer genomes now routinely involves using next-generation sequencing technology (NGS) to profile tumours for single nucleotide variant (SNV) somatic mutations. However, surprisingly few published bioinformatics methods exist for the specific purpose of identifying somatic mutations from NGS data and existing tools are often inaccurate, yielding intolerably high false prediction rates. As such, the computational problem of accurately inferring somatic mutations from paired tumour\/normal NGS data remains an unsolved challenge. Results: We present the comparison of four standard supervised machine learning algorithms for the purpose of somatic SNV prediction in tumour\/normal NGS experiments. To evaluate these approaches (random forest, Bayesian additive regression tree, support vector machine and logistic regression), we constructed 106 features representing 3369 candidate somatic SNVs from 48 breast cancer genomes, originally predicted with naive methods and subsequently revalidated to establish ground truth labels. We trained the classifiers on this data (consisting of 1015 true somatic mutations and 2354 non-somatic mutation positions) and conducted a rigorous evaluation of these methods using a cross-validation framework and hold-out test NGS data from both exome capture and whole genome shotgun platforms. All learning algorithms employing predictive discriminative approaches with feature selection improved the predictive accuracy over standard approaches by statistically significant margins. In addition, using unsupervised clustering of the ground truth 'false positive' predictions, we noted several distinct classes and present evidence suggesting non-overlapping sources of technical artefacts illuminating important directions for future study.

We implement an R package, UNsupervised DecOnvolution (UNDO), that can be used to automatically detect cell-specific marker genes (MGs) located on the scatter radii of mixed gene expressions, estimate cellular proportions in each sample and deconvolute mixed expressions into cell-specific expression profiles. We demonstrate the performance of UNDO over a wide range of tumor-stroma mixing proportions, validate UNDO on various biologically mixed benchmark gene expression datasets and further estimate tumor purity in TCGA\/CPTAC datasets. The highly accurate deconvolution results obtained suggest not only the existence of cell-specific MGs but also UNDO's ability to detect them blindly and correctly.

This can yield important insights into fundamental biological questions ranging from cell type identity to tumour development. For each subject, the data measurements can be written as a matrix with the different subsamples (e.g. multiple tissues) indexing the columns and the genes indexing the rows. In this context, neither the genes nor the tissues are expected to be independent and straightforward application of traditional statistical methods that ignore this two-way dependence might lead to erroneous conclusions.

Strand-specific reads allow for detection of antisense events and a higher resolution of expression profiles enabling extension of current transcript annotations. However, applications making use of this strandedness information are still scarce. Results: Here we present a tool (Janus), which focuses on the identification of transcriptional active regions in antisense orientation to known and novel transcribed elements of the genome. Janus can compare the antisense events of multiple samples and assigns scores to identify mutual expression of either transcript in a sense\/ antisense pair, which could hint to regulatory mechanisms. Janus is able to make use of single-nucleotide variant (SNV) and methylation data, if available, and reports the sense to antisense ratio of regions in the vicinity of the identified genetic and epigenetic variation. Janus interrogates positions of heterozygous SNVs to identify strand-specific allelic imbalance.

Although sequencing-based technologies are increasingly allowing high-resolution measurements of DNA methylation, statistical modelling of such data is still challenging. In particular, statistical identification of differentially methylated regions across different conditions poses unresolved challenges in accounting for spatial correlations within the statistical testing procedure.\n        Results: We propose a non-parametric, kernel-based method, M3D, to detect higher order changes in methylation profiles, such as shape, across pre-defined regions. The test statistic explicitly accounts for differences in coverage levels between samples, thus handling in a principled way a major confounder in the analysis of methylation data. Empirical tests on real and simulated datasets show an increased power compared to established methods, as well as considerable robustness with respect to coverage and replication levels.\n        Availability and implementation: R\/Bioconductor package M3D.\n        Contact:\nG.Sanguinetti@ed.ac.uk\n        Supplementary information:\nSupplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.","language":["R"],"source":"PMC Extraction","repoUpdatedDate":Sat Apr 01 07:59:53 PDT 2017,"repoHomepage":"","platforms":["Linux (Unix)","Windows 32","Windows 64","Mac OS X 10.6","Mac OS X 10.9"],"linkDescriptions":null,"emails":["G.Sanguinetti@ed.ac.uk"],"linkUrls":["http:\/\/bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org\/lookup\/suppl\/doi:10.1093\/bioinformatics\/btu749\/-\/DC1","http:\/\/bioconductor.org\/packages\/release\/bioc\/src\/contrib\/M3D_1.3.4.tar.gz","http:\/\/bioconductor.org\/packages\/release\/bioc\/html\/M3D.html","http:\/\/bioconductor.org\/packages\/release\/bioc\/vignettes\/M3D\/inst\/doc\/M3D_vignette.pdf"],"publicationReferences":[29],"dateCreated":Thu Jul 06 10:50:55 PDT 2017,"repoCreationDate":Fri Mar 27 07:05:42 PDT 2015,"suggestTag":["Genome Analysis"],"suggestTagPrefix":["Genome Analysis"],"id":11137,"repoDownloads":85,"publicationDate":["2014-11-13T00:00:00Z"],"repoForks":0,"codeRepoURL":"http:\/\/bioconductor.org\/packages\/release\/bioc\/html\/M3D.html","funding":["Medical Research Council: BB\/F529254\/1","Medical Research Council: EP\/F500385\/1","Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council: Grant not found"],"types":["Tool"],"repoOwner":"Bioconductor-mirror","repoName":"M3D","suggestName":"M3D","publicationPMID":[25398611],"domains":["Statistics and Probability","Computational Theory and Mathematics","Biochemistry","Molecular Biology","Computational Mathematics","Computer Science Applications","Genomics","Epigenomics"],"publicationTitle":["M3D: a kernel-based test for spatially correlated changes in methylation profiles."],"publicationDOI":["10.1093\/bioinformatics\/btu749"],"dateUpdated":Fri Jul 07 02:13:20 PDT 2017,"tags":["Genome Analysis","DNAMethylation","DifferentialMethylation","Coverage","CpGIsland"],"institutions":["University of Edinburgh"],"publicationJournal":["Bioinformatics"],"license":"Artistic License 2.0","_version_":1572223389444079616,"name":"M3D","suggestNamePrefix":"M3D","authorEmails":null,"authors":["Tom R TR Mayo","Gabriele G Schweikert","Guido G Sanguinetti","Tom Mayo"]},{"fundingAgencies":["Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada","Max Planck Society"],"suggestName":"deindexer","domains":["Metagenomics","Statistics and Probability","Computational Theory and Mathematics","Biochemistry","Molecular Biology","Computational Mathematics","Computer Science Applications"],"description":"Motivation: Pooling multiple samples increases the efficiency and lowers the cost of DNA sequenc-ing. One approach to multiplexing is to use short DNA indices to uniquely identify each sample. After sequencing, reads must be assigned in silico to the sample of origin, a process referred to as demultiplexing. Demultiplexing software typically identifies the sample of origin using a fixed number of mismatches between the read index and a reference index set. This approach may fail or misassign reads when the sequencing quality of the indices is poor. Results: We introduce deML, a maximum likelihood algorithm that demultiplexes Illumina sequences. deML computes the likelihood of an observed index sequence being derived from a specified sample. A quality score which reflects the probability of the assignment being correct is generated for each read. Using these quality scores, even very problematic datasets can be demultiplexed and an error threshold can be set.

Peak detection is an essential step for MS-based proteomic data analysis. Recently, several peak detection algorithms have been proposed. However, in these algorithms, there are three major deficiencies: (i) because the noise is often removed, the true signal could also be removed; (ii) baseline removal step may get rid of true peaks and create new false peaks; (iii) in peak quantification step, a threshold of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is usually used to remove false peaks; however, noise estimations in SNR calculation are often inaccurate in either time or wavelet domain. In this article, we propose new algorithms to solve these problems. First, we use bivariate shrinkage estimator in stationary wavelet domain to avoid removing true peaks in denoising step. Second, without baseline removal, zero-crossing lines in multi-scale of derivative Gaussian wavelets are investigated with mixture of Gaussian to estimate discriminative parameters of peaks. Third, in quantification step, the frequency, SD, height and rank of peaks are used to detect both high and small energy peaks with robustness to noise. Results: We propose a novel Gaussian Derivative Wavelet (GDWavelet) method to more accurately detect true peaks with a lower false discovery rate than existing methods. The proposed GDWavelet method has been performed on the real Surface-Enhanced Laser Desorption\/Ionization Time-Of-Flight (SELDI-TOF) spectrum with known polypeptide positions and on two synthetic data with Gaussian and real noise. All experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms other commonly used methods. The standard receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves are used to evaluate the experimental results.","language":["R"],"source":"Grobid Extraction: Bioinformatics","platforms":["Linux (Unix)","Windows 32","Windows 64","Mac OS X 10.6","Mac OS X 10.9"],"linkDescriptions":null,"linkUrls":["http:\/\/bioconductor.org\/packages\/release\/bioc\/src\/contrib\/MassSpecWavelet_1.34.0.tar.gz","http:\/\/bioconductor.org\/packages\/release\/bioc\/html\/MassSpecWavelet.html","http:\/\/bioconductor.org\/packages\/release\/bioc\/vignettes\/MassSpecWavelet\/inst\/doc\/MassSpecWavelet.pdf","http:\/\/bioinformatics.mdanderson.org\/cromwell.html","http:\/\/bioconductor.org\/packages\/2.5\/bioc\/html\/MassSpecWavelet.html","http:\/\/bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org","http:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licenses\/by-nc\/2.5","http:\/\/camda.duke.edu\/camda06\/datasets\/index.html","http:\/\/bioinformatics.mdanderson.org\/Supplements\/Datasets\/Simulations\/index.html","http:\/\/ranger.uta.edu","http:\/\/www.naaan.org\/nhanguyen\/archive.htmContact"],"dateCreated":Tue Sep 07 10:41:46 PDT 2010,"suggestTag":["noise","methods","estimations","signals","data","peaks"],"suggestTagPrefix":["noise","methods","estimations","signals","data","peaks"],"id":11146,"repoDownloads":543,"repoForks":0,"codeRepoURL":"http:\/\/bioconductor.org\/packages\/release\/bioc\/html\/MassSpecWavelet.html","types":["Tool"],"repoName":"MassSpecWavelet","suggestName":"MassSpecWavelet","domains":["Proteomics","Metabolomics"],"publicationDOI":["10.1093\/bioinformatics\/btq397"],"tags":["MassSpectrometry","Proteomics","noise","methods","estimations","signals","data","peaks"],"dateUpdated":Fri Jul 07 02:24:43 PDT 2017,"institutions":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering","The Feinstein Institute for Medical Research North Shore LIJ Health System","Department of Electrical Engineering University of Texas at Arlington"],"license":"LGPL (>= 2)","_version_":1572286059120689152,"name":"MassSpecWavelet","suggestNamePrefix":"MassSpecWavelet","authorEmails":null,"authors":["Pan Du","Warren Kibbe","Simon Lin","Nha Nguyen","Heng Huang","Soontorn Oraintara","An Vo"]},{"fundingAgencies":["Wellcome Trust","Medical Research Council"],"repoDescription":"A fully developed set of DNA sequence assembly (Gap4 and Gap5), editing and analysis tools (Spin) for Unix, Linux, MacOSX and MS Windows.","repo":"sourceforge","description":"Motivation: Existing sequence assembly editors struggle with the volumes of data now readily available from the latest generation of DNA sequencing instruments.\n        Results: We describe the Gap5 software along with the data structures and algorithms used that allow it to be scalable.

In some cases, the evolutionary history and population frequency of the subclonal lineages of tumor cells present in the sample can be reconstructed from these SNV frequency measurements. But automated methods to do this reconstruction are not available and the conditions under which reconstruction is possible have not been described. Results: We describe the conditions under which the evolutionary history can be uniquely reconstructed from SNV frequencies from single or multiple samples from the tumor population and we introduce a new statistical model, PhyloSub, that infers the phylogeny and genotype of the major subclonal lineages represented in the population of cancer cells. It uses a Bayesian nonparametric prior over trees that groups SNVs into major subclonal lineages and automatically estimates the number of lineages and their ancestry. We sample from the joint posterior distribution over trees to identify evolutionary histories and cell population frequencies that have the highest probability of generating the observed SNV frequency data. When multiple phylogenies are consistent with a given set of SNV frequencies, PhyloSub represents the uncertainty in the tumor phylogeny using a \" partial order plot \". Experiments on a simulated dataset and two real datasets comprising tumor samples from acute myeloid leukemia and chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients demonstrate that PhyloSub can infer both linear (or chain) and branching lineages and its inferences are in good agreement with ground truth, where it is available. Conclusions: PhyloSub can be applied to frequencies of any \" binary \" somatic mutation, including SNVs as well as small insertions and deletions.

The consequent possibility to simultaneously sample multiple layers of variation along the gene expression flow requires computational methods integrating raw information from different \u2018-omics\u2019. It has been recently demonstrated that translational control is a widespread phenomenon, with profound and still underestimated regulation capabilities. Although detecting changes in the levels of total messenger RNAs (mRNAs; the transcriptome), of polysomally loaded mRNAs (the translatome) and of proteins (the proteome) is experimentally feasible in a high-throughput way, the integration of these levels is still far from being robustly approached. Here we introduce tRanslatome, a new R\/Bioconductor package, which is a complete platform for the simultaneous pairwise analysis of transcriptome, translatome and proteome data. The package includes most of the available statistical methods developed for the analysis of high-throughput data, allowing the parallel comparison of differentially expressed genes and the corresponding differentially enriched biological themes.

Yet, gene trees often differ from species trees, creating challenges to species tree estimation. One of the most frequent causes for conflicting topologies between gene trees and species trees is incomplete lineage sorting (ILS), which is modelled by the multi-species coalescent. While many methods have been developed to estimate species trees from multiple genes, some which have statistical guarantees under the multi-species coalescent model, existing methods are too computationally intensive for use with genome-scale analyses or have been shown to have poor accuracy under some realistic conditions.\n                We present ASTRAL, a fast method for estimating species trees from multiple genes. ASTRAL is statistically consistent, can run on datasets with thousands of genes and has outstanding accuracy-improving on MP-EST and the population tree from BUCKy, two statistically consistent leading coalescent-based methods. ASTRAL is often more accurate than concatenation using maximum likelihood, except when ILS levels are low or there are too few gene trees.\n                ASTRAL is available in open source form at https:\/\/github.com\/smirarab\/ASTRAL\/.

Meta-analysis using functionally or biologically characterized gene sets simplifies data integration is biologically intuitive and is seen as having great potential, but is an emerging field with few established statistical methods.\n        Results: We transform gene expression profiles into binary gene set profiles by discretizing results of gene set enrichment analyses and apply a new iterative bi-clustering algorithm (iBBiG) to identify groups of gene sets that are coordinately associated with groups of phenotypes across multiple studies. iBBiG is optimized for meta-analysis of large numbers of diverse genomics data that may have unmatched samples. It does not require prior knowledge of the number or size of clusters. When applied to simulated data, it outperforms commonly used clustering methods, discovers overlapping clusters of diverse sizes and is robust in the presence of noise. We apply it to meta-analysis of breast cancer studies, where iBBiG extracted novel gene set\u2014phenotype association that predicted tumor metastases within tumor subtypes.\n        Availability: Implemented in the Bioconductor package iBBiG\n        Contact:\naedin@jimmy.harvard.edu","language":["R"],"source":"PMC Extraction","repoUpdatedDate":Fri May 06 10:15:01 PDT 2016,"repoHomepage":"","platforms":["Linux (Unix)","Windows 32","Windows 64","Mac OS X 10.6","Mac OS X 10.9"],"linkDescriptions":null,"emails":["aedin@jimmy.harvard.edu"],"linkUrls":["http:\/\/bioconductor.org\/packages\/release\/bioc\/vignettes\/iBBiG\/inst\/doc\/tutorial.pdf","http:\/\/bioconductor.org\/packages\/release\/bioc\/src\/contrib\/iBBiG_1.12.0.tar.gz","http:\/\/bioconductor.org\/packages\/release\/bioc\/html\/iBBiG.html"],"publicationReferences":[41],"dateCreated":Thu Jul 06 10:46:31 PDT 2017,"repoCreationDate":Fri Mar 27 09:43:56 PDT 2015,"suggestTag":["Systems Biology"],"suggestTagPrefix":["Systems Biology"],"id":11194,"repoDownloads":150,"publicationDate":["2012-07-12T00:00:00Z"],"repoForks":1,"codeRepoURL":"http:\/\/bioconductor.org\/packages\/release\/bioc\/html\/iBBiG.html","funding":["NIH: 1U19CA148065","HHS: 1U19CA148065","NCI: 1U19CA148065"],"types":["Tool"],"repoOwner":"Bioconductor-mirror","repoName":"iBBiG","suggestName":"iBBiG","publicationPMID":[22789589],"domains":["Statistics and Probability","Computational Theory and Mathematics","Biochemistry","Molecular Biology","Computational Mathematics","Computer Science Applications","Genomics"],"publicationTitle":["iBBiG: iterative binary bi-clustering of gene sets."],"publicationDOI":["10.1093\/bioinformatics\/bts438"],"dateUpdated":Fri Jul 07 02:13:16 PDT 2017,"tags":["Systems Biology","Clustering","Annotation","GeneSetEnrichment"],"institutions":["Universiteit Stellenbosch","University of Oxford","Harvard School of Public Health"],"publicationJournal":["Bioinformatics"],"license":"Artistic-2.0","_version_":1572223238803554304,"name":"iBBiG","suggestNamePrefix":"iBBiG","authorEmails":null,"authors":["Daniel D Gusenleitner","Eleanor A EA Howe","Stefan S Bentink","John J Quackenbush","AedÃ­n C AC Culhane","Daniel Gusenleitner","Aedin Culhane"]},{"outputFiles":["Data"],"types":["Widget"],"suggestName":"biojs-rest-ensembl","description":"rest api for ensembl","language":["JavaScript"],"source":"elixir","inputFiles":["Data"],"platforms":["Web UI"],"tags":["Bioinformatics","rest","ensembl"],"dateUpdated":Fri Jul 07 02:12:41 PDT 2017,"linkDescriptions":null,"linkUrls":["http:\/\/biojs.net\/","http:\/\/github.com\/daviddao\/biojs-rest-ensembl","https:\/\/github.com\/biojs\/biojs2\/issues","https:\/\/www.npmjs.com\/package\/biojs-rest-ensembl"],"dateCreated":Mon Nov 09 21:01:32 PST 2015,"suggestTag":["Bioinformatics"],"suggestTagPrefix":["Bioinformatics"],"_version_":1572282950897106944,"name":"biojs-rest-ensembl","suggestNamePrefix":"biojs-rest-ensembl","id":11195,"authorEmails":null,"authors":["Kieron Taylor"]},{"fundingAgencies":["NIH","NIGMS","HHS"],"repoDescription":"An Empirical Bayesian Approach to Differential Co-Expression Analysis at the Gene-Pair Level","repo":"bioconductor","description":"Summary: R\/EBcoexpress implements the approach of Dawson and Kendziorski using R, a freely available, open source statistical programming language.

The modified X!Tandem C++ source code is Artistic licensed, supports pluggable scoring, and is available as part of the Sashimi project at http:\/\/sashimi.svn.sourceforge.net\/viewvc\/sashimi\/trunk\/trans_proteomic_pipeline\/extern\/xtandem\/. The MR-Tandem Python script is Apache licensed and available as part of the Insilicos Cloud Army project at http:\/\/ica.svn.sourceforge.net\/viewvc\/ica\/trunk\/mr-tandem\/. Full documentation and a windows installer that configures MR-Tandem, Python and all necessary packages are available at this same URL.\n        \n          Contact:\n          brian.pratt@insilicos.com","language":["Perl"],"source":"PMC Extraction","repoUpdatedDate":Fri Jun 23 09:07:33 PDT 2017,"repoHomepage":"http:\/\/tools.proteomecenter.org\/wiki","linkDescriptions":null,"linkUrls":["http:\/\/sashimi.svn.sourceforge.net\/viewvc\/sashimi\/trunk\/trans_proteomic_pipeline\/src\/Quantitation\/Pepc","http:\/\/ica.svn.sourceforge.net\/viewvc\/ica\/trunk\/mr-tandem","http:\/\/sashimi.svn.sourceforge.net\/viewvc\/sashimi\/trunk\/trans_proteomic_pipeline\/extern\/xtandem"],"publicationReferences":[15],"dateCreated":Thu Jul 06 10:50:53 PDT 2017,"repoCreationDate":Thu Dec 12 16:00:00 PST 2002,"suggestTag":["Systems Biology"],"suggestTagPrefix":["Systems Biology"],"id":11206,"repoDownloads":0,"publicationDate":["2010-04-22T00:00:00Z"],"repoForks":0,"codeRepoURL":"sourceforge.net\/viewvc\/sashimi","funding":["NIH: HG004537","NHGRI: HG004537","HHS: HG004537","Canadian Institutes of Health Research: Grant not found","NIH: R43 HG006091","NHGRI: R43 HG006091","HHS: R43 HG006091","NIH: HG006091","NHGRI: HG006091","HHS: HG006091"],"repoOwner":"adkeller","repoName":"SASHIMI","suggestName":"SASHIMI","publicationPMID":[20413636],"domains":["Statistics and Probability","Computational Theory and Mathematics","Biochemistry","Molecular Biology","Computational Mathematics","Computer Science Applications"],"publicationTitle":["PepC: proteomics software for identifying differentially expressed proteins based on spectral counting."],"publicationDOI":["10.1093\/bioinformatics\/btq171","10.1093\/bioinformatics\/btr615"],"dateUpdated":Thu Jul 06 10:50:53 PDT 2017,"tags":["Gene Expression","Systems Biology"],"institutions":["University of Washington"],"publicationJournal":["Bioinformatics"],"license":"GNU Library or Lesser General Public License version 2.0 (LGPLv2)","_version_":1572223365011210240,"name":"SASHIMI","suggestNamePrefix":"SASHIMI","authorEmails":null,"authors":["N L NL Heinecke","B S BS Pratt","T T Vaisar","L L Becker","Brian B Pratt","J Jeffry JJ Howbert","Natalie I NI Tasman","Erik J EJ Nilsson"]},{"fundingAgencies":["NIH","NCI","HHS"],"repoDescription":"Database search is the most widely used approach for peptide and protein identification in mass spectrometry-based proteomics studies.

To efficiently facilitate large-scale NGS resequencing data analysis of genomic variations, we have developed \" PGen \" , an integrated and optimized workflow using the Extreme Science and Engineering Discovery Environment (XSEDE) high-performance computing (HPC) virtual system, iPlant cloud data storage resources and Pegasus workflow management system (Pegasus-WMS). The workflow allows users to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and insertion-deletions (indels), perform SNP annotations and conduct copy number variation analyses on multiple resequencing datasets in a user-friendly and seamless way. Results: We have developed both a Linux version in GitHub (https:\/\/github.com\/pegasus-isi\/PGen-GenomicVariations-Workflow) and a web-based implementation of the PGen workflow integrated within the Soybean Knowledge Base (SoyKB), (http:\/\/soykb.org\/Pegasus\/index.php). Using PGen, we identified 10,218,140 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and 1,398,982 indels from analysis of 106 soybean lines sequenced at 15X coverage. 297,245 non-synonymous SNPs and 3330 copy number variation (CNV) regions were identified from this analysis. SNPs identified using PGen from additional soybean resequencing projects adding to 500+ soybean germplasm lines in total have been integrated. These SNPs are being utilized for trait improvement using genotype to phenotype prediction approaches developed in-house. In order to browse and access NGS data easily, we have also developed an NGS resequencing data browser (http:\/\/soykb.org\/NGS_Resequence\/NGS_index.php) within SoyKB to provide easy access to SNP and downstream analysis results for soybean researchers. Conclusion: PGen workflow has been optimized for the most efficient analysis of soybean data using thorough testing and validation. This research serves as an example of best practices for development of genomics data analysis workflows by integrating remote HPC resources and efficient data management with ease of use for biological users. PGen workflow can also be easily customized for analysis of data in other species.","language":["Java"],"source":"Migration","repoUpdatedDate":Wed Jul 05 17:10:07 PDT

We also have new features (over and above what is offered in the Siemens SWI product for the 3T TRIO) for performing anti-aliasing and special processing of high pass filtered phase images. The MRA module offers a region growing algorithm to find the vessel tree starting from a specific vessel, and has the ability to simulate vessel flow. The PWI module provides cerebral blood volume (CBV), first moment mean transit time (fMTT), cerebral blood flow (CBF), bolus arriving time BAT), full-width half maximum estimates of MTT, time-to peak (TTP) and peak change in signal (PCS) images. All these maps are available in color coded images. The DCE module generates IAUC and CIAUC plots directly to a Microsoft Excel chart. SPIN also includes basic algorithms in imaging processing, such as subtraction, superimpositon, pixel division, averaging, offset shifting, edge detection, erosion, dilation, 2D parabolic fitting, sliding window filtering, complex thresholding, chirp-z transform dilation, and partial Fourier Transform processing.","domains":["Proteomics"],"source":"User Submission","inputFiles":["DICOM","Protein sequence"],"platforms":["Windows","Web UI"],"dateUpdated":Mon Nov 09 21:01:32 PST 2015,"tags":["Data deposition, annotation and curation","Proteins"],"linkDescriptions":null,"institutions":["Magnetic Resonance Imaging Institute for Biomedical Research","EMBL-EBI"],"linkUrls":["","http:\/\/mrinnovations.com\/index.php?site=spin","https:\/\/www.ebi.ac.uk\/swissprot\/Submissions\/spin\/","http:\/\/www.ebi.ac.uk\/about\/terms-of-use","https:\/\/www.ebi.ac.uk\/swissprot\/Submissions\/spin\/help"],"dateCreated":Fri Oct 23 17:16:27 PDT 2015,"_version_":1572283228331442176,"name":"SPIN","suggestNamePrefix":"SPIN","id":11221},{"types":["Tool"],"suggestName":"whatizit","description":"Whatizit is a text processing system that allows you to do textmining tasks on text.\r\nWhatizit is great at identifying molecular biology terms and linking them to publicly available databases. \r\n\r\nweb interface: http:\/\/www.ebi.ac.uk\/webservices\/whatizit\/i","source":"BioCatalogue","platforms":["SOAP WS","SOAP"],"tags":["Data mining","ebi","textmining","text mining","bioinformatics","Text Mining"],"dateUpdated":Mon Nov 09 21:02:00 PST 2015,"linkDescriptions":null,"linkUrls":["http:\/\/www.ebi.ac.uk\/webservices\/whatizit\/helpws.jsp;jsessionid=C1ADA3F4CEF9C1D61E99739D8627CB4D","http:\/\/www.ebi.ac.uk\/webservices\/whatizit\/ws?wsdl","http:\/\/www.ebi.ac.uk:80\/webservices\/whatizit\/ws","https:\/\/www.biocatalogue.org\/services\/1450"],"institutions":["European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI)"],"dateCreated":Mon Nov 09 21:02:00 PST 2015,"suggestTag":["ebi","textmining","text mining","bioinformatics","Text Mining"],"suggestTagPrefix":["ebi","textmining","text mining","bioinformatics","Text Mining"],"_version_":1572284374761603072,"name":"whatizit","suggestNamePrefix":"whatizit","id":11222},{"fundingAgencies":["Cancer Research UK","Medical Research Council"],"repoDescription":"This package is an implementation of the BayesPeak algorithm for peak-calling in ChIP-seq data.","repo":"bioconductor","description":"Motivation: Identification of genomic regions of interest in ChIP-seq data, commonly referred to as peak-calling, aims to find the locations of transcription factor binding sites, modified histones or nucleosomes.

However, in practice terms are not always expressed consistently, and we must develop methods for identifying terms that are not univocal so that they can be corrected.\n        Results: We developed an automated transformation-based clustering methodology for detecting terms that use different linguistic conventions for expressing similar semantics. These term sets represent occurrences of univocality violations. Our method was able to identify 67 examples of univocality violations in the Gene Ontology.\n        Availability: The identified univocality violations are available upon request.

Single-category enrichment analysis procedures such as Fisher's exact test tend to flag large numbers of redundant categories as significant, which can complicate interpretation.

We propose a Bayesian framework to customize experiments so that goals can be attained and resources are not wasted, with a focus on alternative splicing.\n                We studied how read length, sequencing depth, library preparation and the number of replicates affects cost-effectiveness of single-sample and group comparison studies. Optimal settings varied strongly according to the target organism or tissue (potential 50-500% cost cuts) and, interestingly, short reads outperformed long reads for standard analyses. Our framework learns key characteristics for study design from the data, and predicts if and how to continue experimentation. These predictions matched several follow-up experimental datasets that were used for validation. We provide default pipelines, but the framework can be combined with other data analysis methods and can help assess their relative merits.\n                casper package at www.bioconductor.org\/packages\/release\/bioc\/html\/casper.html, Supplementary Manual by typing casperDesign() at the R prompt.\n                rosselldavid@gmail.com\n                Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.\n                Â© The Author 2015.

Various data processing methods have been developed for exploring the resultant high volume data. However, most of these methods process data in the spectral domain and do not make the most of the important spatial information available through this technology. Therefore, we propose a novel streamlined data analysis pipeline specifically developed for MALDI-IMS data utilizing significant spatial information for identifying hidden significant molecular distribution patterns in these complex datasets. Methods: The proposed unsupervised algorithm uses Sliding Window Normalization (SWN) and a new spatial distribution based peak picking method developed based on Gray level Co-Occurrence (GCO) matrices followed by clustering of biomolecules. We also use gist descriptors and an improved version of GCO matrices to extract features from molecular images and minimum medoid distance to automatically estimate the number of possible groups. Results: We evaluated our algorithm using a new MALDI-IMS metabolomics dataset of a plant (Eucalypt) leaf. The algorithm revealed hidden significant molecular distribution patterns in the dataset, which the current Component Analysis and Segmentation Map based approaches failed to extract. We further demonstrate the performance of our peak picking method over other traditional approaches by using a publicly available MALDI-IMS proteomics dataset of a rat brain. Although SWN did not show any significant improvement as compared with using no normalization, the visual assessment showed an improvement as compared to using the median normalization.

The deepSNV algorithm is used for a comparative setup with a control experiment of the same loci and uses a beta-binomial model and a likelihood ratio test to discriminate sequencing errors and subclonal SNVs. The shearwater algorithm computes a Bayes classifier based on a beta-binomial model for variant calling with multiple samples for precisely estimating model parameters such as local error rates and dispersion and prior knowledge, e.g. from variation data bases such as COSMIC.","repo":"bioconductor","description":"Motivation: Targeted resequencing of cancer genes in large cohorts of patients is important to understand the biological and clinical consequences of mutations. Cancers are often clonally heterogeneous, and the detection of subclonal mutations is important from a diagnostic point of view, but presents strong statistical challenges.\n        Results: Here we present a novel statistical approach for calling mutations from large cohorts of deeply resequenced cancer genes. These data allow for precisely estimating local error profiles and enable detecting mutations with high sensitivity and specificity. Our probabilistic method incorporates knowledge about the distribution of variants in terms of a prior probability. We show that our algorithm has a high accuracy of calling cancer mutations and demonstrate that the detected clonal and subclonal variants have important prognostic consequences.\n        Availability: Code is available as part of the Bioconductor package deepSNV.\n        Contact:\nmg14@sanger.ac.uk; pc8@sanger.ac.uk","language":["R"],"source":"PMC Extraction","repoUpdatedDate":Mon Apr 24 06:53:13 PDT 2017,"repoHomepage":"","platforms":["Linux (Unix)","Windows 32","Windows 64","Mac OS X 10.6","Mac OS X 10.9"],"linkDescriptions":null,"emails":["mg14@sanger.ac.uk","pc8@sanger.ac.uk"],"linkUrls":["http:\/\/bioconductor.org\/packages\/release\/bioc\/vignettes\/deepSNV\/inst\/doc\/shearwater.pdf","http:\/\/bioconductor.org\/packages\/release\/bioc\/html\/deepSNV.html","http:\/\/bioconductor.org\/packages\/release\/bioc\/src\/contrib\/deepSNV_1.14.2.tar.gz","http:\/\/bioconductor.org\/packages\/release\/bioc\/vignettes\/deepSNV\/inst\/doc\/deepSNV.pdf,"],"publicationReferences":[18],"dateCreated":Thu Jul 06 10:48:51 PDT 2017,"repoCreationDate":Fri Mar 27 08:40:42 PDT 2015,"suggestTag":["Genome Analysis"],"suggestTagPrefix":["Genome Analysis"],"id":11257,"repoDownloads":147,"publicationDate":["2014-01-16T00:00:00Z"],"repoForks":4,"codeRepoURL":"http:\/\/bioconductor.org\/packages\/release\/bioc\/html\/deepSNV.html","funding":["Wellcome Trust: 088340","Wellcome Trust: 077012\/Z\/05\/Z","Wellcome Trust: WT088340MA"],"types":["Tool"],"repoOwner":"Bioconductor-mirror","repoName":"deepSNV","suggestName":"deepSNV","publicationPMID":[24443148],"domains":["Statistics and Probability","Computational Theory and Mathematics","Biochemistry","Molecular Biology","Computational Mathematics","Computer Science Applications","Genomics"],"publicationTitle":["Subclonal variant calling with multiple samples and prior knowledge."],"publicationDOI":["10.1093\/bioinformatics\/btt750"],"dateUpdated":Fri Jul 07 02:12:10 PDT 2017,"tags":["Genome Analysis","GeneticVariability","SNP","Sequencing","Genetics","DataImport"],"institutions":["Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute","University of Cambridge","Univerzita Karlova"],"publicationJournal":["Bioinformatics"],"license":"GPL-3","_version_":1572223326344970240,"name":"deepSNV","suggestNamePrefix":"deepSNV","authorEmails":null,"authors":["Moritz M Gerstung","Elli E Papaemmanuil","Peter J PJ Campbell","Niko Beerenwinkel [ths]","David Jones [ctb]","Inigo Martincorena [ctb]","Moritz Gerstung [aut"]},{"fundingAgencies":["NIH","NHGRI","HHS"],"repoDescription":"The HiTC package was developed to explore high-throughput 'C' data such as 5C or Hi-C.

However, the storage and analysis of transcriptome information from different NGS platforms is still a significant bottleneck, leading to a delay in data dissemination and subsequent biological understanding. Especially database interfaces with transcriptome analysis modules going beyond mere read counts are missing. Here, we present the Transcriptome Analysis and Comparison Explorer (T-ACE), a tool designed for the organization and analysis of large sequence datasets, and especially suited for transcriptome projects of non-model organisms with little or no a priori sequence information. T-ACE offers a TCL-based interface, which accesses a PostgreSQL database via a php-script. Within T-ACE, information belonging to single sequences or contigs, such as annotation or read coverage, is linked to the respective sequence and immediately accessible. Sequences and assigned information can be searched via keyword-or BLAST-search. Additionally, T-ACE provides within and between transcriptome analysis modules on the level of expression, GO terms, KEGG pathways and protein domains. Results are visualized and can be easily exported for external analysis. We developed T-ACE for laboratory environments, which have only a limited amount of bioinformatics support, and for collaborative projects in which different partners work on the same dataset from different locations or platforms (Windows\/Linux\/MacOS). For laboratories with some experience in bioinformatics and programming, the low complexity of the database structure and open-source code provides a framework that can be customized according to the different needs of the user and transcriptome project.

The sets of genes enriched with specific biological terms (obtained from a FEA platform) are transformed into a network by establishing links between genes based on common functional annotations and common clusters. The network provides a new view of FEA results revealing gene modules with similar functions and genes that are related to multiple functions. In addition to building the functional network, FGNet analyses the similarity between the groups of genes and provides a distance heatmap and a bipartite network of functionally overlapping genes.

Mixture models of mutagenetic trees have been used to describe disease progression in cancer and in HIV. In cancer, progression is modeled by the accumulation of chromosomal gains and losses in tumor cells; in HIV, the accumulation of drug resistance-associated mutations in the viral genome is known to be associated with disease progression. From such evolutionary models, genetic progression scores can be derived that assign measures for the disease state to single patients. Rtreemix is an R package for estimating mixture models of evolutionary pathways from observed cross-sectional data and for estimating associated genetic progression scores. The package also provides extended functionality for estimating confidence intervals for estimated model parameters and for evaluating the stability of the estimated evolutionary mixture models.\n        Availability: Rtreemix is an R package that is freely available from the Bioconductor project at http:\/\/www.bioconductor.org and runs on Linux and Windows.\n        Contact: jasmina@mpi-inf.mpg.de","language":["R"],"source":"PMC Extraction","repoUpdatedDate":Thu May 05 04:59:11 PDT 2016,"repoHomepage":"","platforms":["Linux (Unix)","Windows 32","Windows 64","Mac OS X 10.6","Mac OS X 10.9"],"linkDescriptions":null,"emails":["jasmina@mpi-inf.mpg.de"],"linkUrls":["http:\/\/www.bioconductor.org","http:\/\/bioconductor.org\/packages\/release\/bioc\/html\/Rtreemix.html","http:\/\/bioconductor.org\/packages\/release\/bioc\/vignettes\/Rtreemix\/inst\/doc\/Rtreemix.pdf","http:\/\/bioconductor.org\/packages\/release\/bioc\/src\/contrib\/Rtreemix_1.30.0.tar.gz"],"publicationReferences":[7],"dateCreated":Thu Jul 06 10:42:55 PDT 2017,"repoCreationDate":Fri Mar 27 07:21:39 PDT 2015,"suggestTag":["Genome Analysis"],"suggestTagPrefix":["Genome Analysis"],"id":11274,"repoDownloads":101,"publicationDate":["2008-08-20T00:00:00Z"],"repoForks":0,"codeRepoURL":"http:\/\/bioconductor.org\/packages\/release\/bioc\/html\/Rtreemix.html","types":["Tool"],"repoOwner":"Bioconductor-mirror","repoName":"Rtreemix","suggestName":"Rtreemix","publicationPMID":[18718947],"domains":["Statistics and Probability","Computational Theory and Mathematics","Biochemistry","Molecular Biology","Computational Mathematics","Computer Science Applications"],"publicationTitle":["Rtreemix: an R package for estimating evolutionary pathways and genetic progression scores."],"publicationDOI":["10.1093\/bioinformatics\/btn410"],"dateUpdated":Fri Jul 07 02:15:31 PDT 2017,"tags":["Genome Analysis","StatisticalMethod"],"publicationJournal":["Bioinformatics"],"license":"LGPL","_version_":1572223053992034304,"name":"Rtreemix","suggestNamePrefix":"Rtreemix","authorEmails":null,"authors":["Jasmina J Bogojeska","Adrian A Alexa","AndrÃ© A Altmann","Thomas T Lengauer","JÃ¶rg J RahnenfÃ¼hrer","Jasmina Bogojeska"]},{"repoDescription":"Official code repository for GATK versions 1.0 through 3.7 (full licensed package).

We reanalyzed the same datasets twice, using the same tools with the same parameters, where we only altered the order of reads in the input (i.e. FASTQ file). Reshuffling caused the reads from repetitive regions being mapped to different locations in the second alignment, and we observed similar results when we only applied a scatter\/gather approach for read mappingâ\u0080\u0094without prior shuffling. Our results show that, some of the most common variation discovery algorithms do not handle the ambiguous read mappings accurately when random locations are selected. In addition, we also observed that even when the exact same alignment is used, the GATK HaplotypeCaller generates slightly different call sets, which we pinpoint to the variant filtration step. We conclude that, algorithms at each step of genomic variation discovery and characterization need to treat ambiguous mappings in a deterministic fashion to ensure full replication of results.

The scientific value of an animal model depends on how accurately it mimics the human disease. In principle, microarrays collect the necessary data to evaluate the transcriptomic fidelity of an animal model in terms of the similarity of expression with the human disease. However, statistical methods for this purpose are lacking.\n        Results: We develop the agreement of differential expression (AGDEX) procedure to measure and determine the statistical significance of the similarity of the results of two experiments that measure differential expression across two groups. AGDEX defines a metric of agreement and determines statistical significance by permutation of each experiment's group labels. Additionally, AGDEX performs a comprehensive permutation-based analysis of differential expression for each experiment, including gene-set analyses and meta-analytic integration of results across studies. As an example, we show how AGDEX was recently used to evaluate the similarity of the transcriptome of a novel model of the brain tumor ependymoma in mice to that of a subtype of the human disease. This result, combined with other observations, helped us to infer the cell of origin of this devastating human cancer.\n        Availability: An R package is currently available from www.stjuderesearch.org\/site\/depts\/biostats\/agdex and will shortly be available from www.bioconductor.org.\n        Contact: stanley.pounds@stjude.org\n        Supplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.","language":["R"],"source":"PMC Extraction","repoUpdatedDate":Tue May 03 14:22:14 PDT 2016,"repoHomepage":"","platforms":["Linux (Unix)","Windows 32","Windows 64","Mac OS X 10.6","Mac OS X 10.9"],"linkDescriptions":null,"linkUrls":["http:\/\/bioconductor.org\/packages\/release\/bioc\/vignettes\/AGDEX\/inst\/doc\/AGDEX.pdf","http:\/\/bioconductor.org\/packages\/release\/bioc\/src\/contrib\/AGDEX_1.16.0.tar.gz","http:\/\/bioconductor.org\/packages\/release\/bioc\/html\/AGDEX.html"],"publicationReferences":[21],"dateCreated":Thu Jul 06 10:50:31 PDT 2017,"repoCreationDate":Fri Mar 27 06:00:30 PDT 2015,"suggestTag":["Gene Expression"],"suggestTagPrefix":["Gene Expression"],"id":11288,"repoDownloads":119,"publicationDate":["2011-06-22T00:00:00Z"],"repoForks":0,"codeRepoURL":"http:\/\/bioconductor.org\/packages\/release\/bioc\/html\/AGDEX.html","funding":["NIH: R01 CA129541","HHS: R01 CA129541","NCI: R01 CA129541","NIH: R01CA129541","HHS: R01CA129541","NCI: R01CA129541","NIH: P01CA96832","HHS: P01CA96832","NCI: P01CA96832","NIH: P30CA21765","HHS: P30CA21765","NCI: P30CA21765","NIH: P30 CA021765","HHS: P30 CA021765","NCI: P30 CA021765","NIH: P01 CA096832","HHS: P01 CA096832","NCI: P01 CA096832"],"types":["Tool"],"repoOwner":"Bioconductor-mirror","repoName":"AGDEX","suggestName":"AGDEX","publicationPMID":[21697127],"domains":["Statistics and Probability","Computational Theory and Mathematics","Biochemistry","Molecular Biology","Computational Mathematics","Computer Science Applications","Genomics"],"publicationTitle":["A procedure to statistically evaluate agreement of differential expression for cross-species genomics."],"publicationDOI":["10.1093\/bioinformatics\/btr362"],"dateUpdated":Fri Jul 07 02:11:45 PDT 2017,"tags":["Gene Expression","Microarray","Genetics","GeneExpression"],"publicationJournal":["Bioinformatics"],"license":"GPL Version 2 or later","_version_":1572223379363069952,"name":"AGDEX","suggestNamePrefix":"AGDEX","authorEmails":null,"authors":["Stan S Pounds","Cuilan Lani CL Gao","Robert A RA Johnson","Karen D KD Wright","Helen H Poppleton","David D Finkelstein","Sarah E S SE Leary","Richard J RJ Gilbertson","Stan Pounds","Cuilan Lani Gao"]},{"types":["Tool"],"suggestName":"WU-BLAST (REST)","description":"WU-BLAST stands for Washington University Basic Local Alignment Search Tool.

Despite the advances in sequencing speed, the computational discovery of structural variants is not yet standard. It is likely that many variants have remained undiscovered in most sequenced individuals. Results: Here, we present a novel internal segment size based approach , which organizes all, including concordant, reads into a read alignment graph, where max-cliques represent maximal contradiction-free groups of alignments. A novel algorithm then enumerates all max-cliques and statistically evaluates them for their potential to reflect insertions or deletions. For the first time in the literature, we compare a large range of state-of-the-art approaches using simulated Illumina reads from a fully annotated genome and present relevant performance statistics. We achieve superior performance, in particular , for deletions or insertions (indels) of length 20â\u0080\u0093100 nt. This has been previously identified as a remaining major challenge in structural variation discovery, in particular, for insert size based approaches. In this size range, we even outperform split-read aligners. We achieve competitive results also on biological data, where our method is the only one to make a substantial amount of correct predictions, which, additionally, are disjoint from those by split-read aligners.

Different modern analytical biochemistry and proteomics methods depend on the isoelectric point as a principal feature for protein and peptide characterization. Protein separation by isoelectric point is a critical part of 2-D gel electrophoresis, a key precursor of proteomics, where discrete spots can be digested in-gel, and proteins subsequently identified by analytical mass spectrometry. Peptide fractionation according to their pI is also widely used in current proteomics sample preparation procedures previous to the LC-MS\/MS analysis. Therefore accurate theoretical prediction of pI would expedite such analysis. While such pI calculation is widely used, it remains largely untested, motivating our efforts to benchmark pI prediction methods. Results: Using data from the database PIP-DB and one publically available dataset as our reference gold standard, we have undertaken the benchmarking of pI calculation methods. We find that methods vary in their accuracy and are highly sensitive to the choice of basis set. The machine-learning algorithms, especially the SVM-based algorithm, showed a superior performance when studying peptide mixtures. In general, learning-based pI prediction methods (such as Cofactor, SVM and Branca) require a large training dataset and their resulting performance will strongly depend of the quality of that data. In contrast with Iterative methods, machine-learning algorithms have the advantage of being able to add new features to improve the accuracy of prediction.","source":"Migration","linkDescriptions":null,"linkUrls":["https:\/\/github.com\/nodejs\/node-v0.x-archive","http:\/\/github.com","https:\/\/github.com","https:\/\/simtk.org\/home","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih","http:\/\/www","http:\/\/www.encyclopediaofmath.org\/index.php?title=About&oldid=20414","http:\/\/cellfinder.org","http:\/\/www.w3.org\/TR\/rdfa-core","http:\/\/zygotebody.com","http:\/\/browser.openworm.org","http:\/\/sbb.cellfinder.org","https:\/\/github.com\/Martinsos\/opal","http:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licenses\/by\/4.0","https:\/\/github.com\/ypri"],"emails":["hkestler@fli-leibniz.de

The structural data of multi-domain PPIs reveal the domain pair (or pairs) that mediate a PPI, and implicitly also the domain pairs that are not involved in the interaction. By analyzing such data, preference relations between domain pairs as interaction mediators may be revealed. Results: Here, we analyze the differential use of domain pairs as mediators of stable interactions based on structurally solved multi-domain protein complexes. Our analysis revealed domain pairs that are preferentially used as interaction mediators and domain pairs that rarely or never mediate interaction, independent of the proteins' context. Between these extremes, there are domain pairs that mediate protein interaction in some protein contexts, while in other contexts different domain pairs predominate over them. By describing the preference relations between domain pairs as a network, we uncovered partial order and transitivity in these relations, which we further exploited for predicting interaction-mediating domains. The preferred domain pairs and the ones over which they predominate differ in several properties, but these differences cannot yet determine explicitly what underlies the differential use of domain pairs as interaction mediators. One property that stood up was the overabundance of homotypic interactions among the preferred domain pairs, supporting previous suggestions on the advantages in the use of domain self-interaction for mediating protein interactions. Finally, we show a possible association between the preferred domain pairs and the function of the complex where they reside.","language":["Python"],"source":"Grobid Extraction: Bioinformatics","repoUpdatedDate":Wed Jul 05 23:39:52 PDT 2017,"repoHomepage":"http:\/\/pymol.org","linkDescriptions":null,"linkUrls":["http:\/\/bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org","http:\/\/pymol.sourceforge.net)with","http:\/\/www.bioinsilico.org\/MVORFFIP","http:\/\/www.bioinsilico.org\/MVORFFIPSupplementary","http:\/\/www.jmol.org","https:\/\/github.com\/hiteshpatel379\/PyWATER","http:\/\/sourceforge.net\/projects","http:\/\/www.pymol.org","http:\/\/sourceforge.net\/projects\/pymol","http:\/\/pymol.sourceforge.net","http:\/\/pymol.sourceforge.net\/.de","http:\/\/www.bioinformatics.org\/cmview","http:\/\/jaligner.sourceforge.net.Pietal,M.J","http:\/\/www.motorprotein.de\/genepainter","http:\/\/www.bioinsilico.org\/PIPRED.Contact","http:\/\/www.bioinsilico.org\/PIPRED.2.2","http:\/\/pymol.sourceforge.net)2.2.2"],"dateCreated":Sat Aug 28 17:12:56 PDT 2010,"suggestTag":["protein domain pairs","interactions","proteins","paired","bioinformatics","domains","networks"],"suggestTagPrefix":["protein domain pairs","interactions","proteins","paired","bioinformatics","domains","networks"],"repoCreationDate":Mon Apr 10 17:00:00 PDT 2000,"id":11299,"repoDownloads":0,"repoForks":0,"codeRepoURL":"pymol.sourceforge.net","funding":["Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft: 2251\/13-1"],"repoOwner":"rwgk","repoName":"PyMOL Molecular Graphics System","suggestName":"PyMOL Molecular Graphics System","domains":["Proteomics","Statistics and Probability","Computational Theory and Mathematics","Biochemistry","Molecular Biology","Computational Mathematics","Computer Science Applications","Biomedical","Metagenomics"],"publicationDOI":["10.1093\/bioinformatics\/bts269","10.1093\/bioinformatics\/btu424","10.1093\/bioinformatics\/btq495","10.1093\/bioinformatics\/btr163","10.1093\/bioinformatics\/btu798","10.1093\/bioinformatics\/btu838"],"tags":["protein structures","proteins","bioinformatics","structurally","predictions","sets","conserved water molecules","clustering","waters","molecule","conservation","pywater","protein domain pairs","interactions","paired","domains","networks","contact map visualization","cmview","visualize","maps","structures","contacting","eukaryotic genes","introns","genomics","genepainter","eukaryotes","trees","peptide conformations","conformational","peptidic","interfaces","modelling"],"dateUpdated":Fri Jul 07 02:25:10 PDT 2017,"institutions":["Leeds Institute of Molecular Medicine Section of Molecular Gastroenterology St. James's University Hospital University of Leeds.

Our empirical analysis of the accuracy and convergence rate of our algorithm , CAncer PRogression Inference (CAPRI), shows that it outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms addressing similar problems. Motivation: Several cancer-related genomic data have become available (e.g. The Cancer Genome Atlas, TCGA) typically involving hundreds of patients. At present, most of these data are aggre-gated in a cross-sectional fashion providing all measurements at the time of diagnosis. Our goal is to infer cancer 'progression' models from such data. These models are represented as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) of collections of 'selectivity' relations, where a mutation in a gene A 'selects' for a later mutation in a gene B. Gaining insight into the structure of such progressions has the potential to improve both the stratification of patients and personalized therapy choices. Results: The CAPRI algorithm relies on a scoring method based on a probabilistic theory developed by Suppes, coupled with bootstrap and maximum likelihood inference. The resulting algorithm is efficient, achieves high accuracy and has good complexity, also, in terms of convergence properties. CAPRI performs especially well in the presence of noise in the data, and with limited sample sizes. Moreover CAPRI, in contrast to other approaches, robustly reconstructs different types of confluent trajectories despite irregularities in the data. We also report on an ongoing investigation using CAPRI to study atypical Chronic Myeloid Leukemia, in which we uncovered non trivial select-ivity relations and exclusivity patterns among key genomic events.

For proteins and nucleic acids, bond orders can be easily deduced but this does not hold for other types of molecules like ligands. For ligands, bond order information is not always provided in molecular databases and thus a variety of approaches tackling this problem have been developed. In this work, we extend an ansatz proposed by Wang et al. that assigns connectivity-based penalty scores and tries to heuristically approximate its optimum. In this work, we present three efficient and exact solvers for the problem replacing the heuristic approximation scheme of the original approach: an A*, an ILP and an fixed-parameter approach (FPT) approach. Results: We implemented and evaluated the original implementation , our A*, ILP and FPT formulation on the MMFF94 validation suite and the KEGG Drug database. We show the benefit of computing exact solutions of the penalty minimization problem and the additional gain when computing all optimal (or even suboptimal) solutions. We close with a detailed comparison of our methods.

around the Github API. Intended for the browser.","repo":"github","description":"Motivation: Modern proteomics studies utilize high-throughput mass spectrometers which can produce data at an astonishing rate. These big mass spectrometry (MS) datasets can easily reach peta-scale level creating storage and analytic problems for large-scale systems biology studies. Each spectrum consists of thousands of peaks which have to be processed to deduce the peptide. However, only a small percentage of peaks in a spectrum are useful for peptide deduction as most of the peaks are either noise or not useful for a given spectrum. This redundant processing of non-useful peaks is a bottleneck for streaming high-throughput processing of big MS data. One way to reduce the amount of computation required in a high-throughput environment is to eliminate non-useful peaks. Existing noise removing algorithms are limited in their data-reduction capability and are compute intensive making them unsuitable for big data and high-throughput environments. In this paper we introduce a novel low-complexity technique based on classification, quantization and sampling of MS peaks. Results: We present a novel data-reductive strategy for analysis of Big MS data. Our algorithm, called MS-REDUCE, is capable of eliminating noisy peaks as well as peaks that do not contribute to peptide deduction before any peptide deduction is attempted. Our experiments have shown up to 100Ã\u0082 speed up over existing state of the art noise elimination algorithms while maintaining comparable high quality matches. Using our approach we were able to process a million spectra in just under an hour on a moderate server.

However, these existing rare variant detection methods are not able to identify which rare variants in a gene or a genetic region of all variants are associated with the complex diseases or traits. Once phenotypic associations of a gene or a genetic region are identified, the natural next step in the association study with sequencing data is to locate the susceptible rare variants within the gene or the genetic region. Results: In this article, we propose a power set-based statistical selection procedure that is able to identify the locations of the potentially susceptible rare variants within a disease-related gene or a genetic region. The selection performance of the proposed selection procedure was evaluated through simulation studies, where we demonstrated the feasibility and superior power over several comparable existing methods. In particular, the proposed method is able to handle the mixed effects when both risk and protective variants are present in a gene or a genetic region. The proposed selection procedure was also applied to the sequence data on the ANGPTL gene family from the Dallas Heart Study to identify potentially susceptible rare variants within the trait-related genes.

Large-scale MeSH indexing has two challenging aspects: the citation side and MeSH side. For the citation side, all existing methods, including Medical Text Indexer (MTI) by National Library of Medicine and the state-of-the-art method, MeSHLabeler, deal with text by bag-of-words, which cannot capture semantic and context-dependent information well. Methods: We propose DeepMeSH that incorporates deep semantic information for large-scale MeSH indexing. It addresses the two challenges in both citation and MeSH sides. The citation side challenge is solved by a new deep semantic representation, D2V-TFIDF, which concatenates both sparse and dense semantic representations. The MeSH side challenge is solved by using the 'learn-ing to rank' framework of MeSHLabeler, which integrates various types of evidence generated from the new semantic representation. Results: DeepMeSH achieved a Micro F-measure of 0.6323, 2% higher than 0.6218 of MeSHLabeler and 12% higher than 0.5637 of MTI, for BioASQ3 challenge data with 6000 citations.","language":["C++"],"source":"Grobid Extraction: Bioinformatics","repoUpdatedDate":Wed Jun 28 06:00:25 PDT 2017,"repoHomepage":"http:\/\/www.lemurproject.org","linkDescriptions":null,"linkUrls":["http:\/\/www.nlm.nih.gov\/bsd\/bsd_key.html","http:\/\/sourceforge.net\/p\/lemur\/wiki\/RankLib","http:\/\/www.nlm.nih.gov\/pubs\/factsheets\/mesh.html","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/books\/NBK25499","http:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licenses\/by-nc\/4.0\/),which","http:\/\/bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org","http:\/\/www.nlm.nih.gov\/pubs\/factsheets\/medline.html","http:\/\/www.nlm.nih.gov\/mesh\/meshhome.html","http:\/\/bioasq.org","http:\/\/www.aueb.gr\/users\/ion\/docs\/jbms_dense_vectors.pdfLe,Q","http:\/\/sourceforge.net\/p\/lemur\/wiki\/RankLib\/)to","http:\/\/radimrehurek.com\/gensim","http:\/\/www.nlm.nih.gov\/pubs\/factsheets\/mesh.html)by","http:\/\/datamining-iip.fudan.edu.cn\/service\/DrugE-RankContact","http:\/\/sourceforge.net\/p\/lemur\/wiki\/RankLib\/.cross-validation","http:\/\/www.rdkit.org\/.Table"],"dateCreated":Wed Jun 15 08:43:52 PDT 2016,"repoCreationDate":Tue Feb 28 16:00:00 PST 2006,"suggestTag":["mesh indexing","indexers","tfidf","citations","meshs","representations"],"suggestTagPrefix":["mesh indexing","indexers","tfidf","citations","meshs","representations"],"id":11320,"repoDownloads":0,"repoForks":0,"mergedID":10966,"codeRepoURL":"sourceforge.net\/p\/lemur","funding":["JSPS: 24300054","National Natural Science Foundation of China: 61170097","National Natural Science Foundation of China: 61332013","National Natural Science Foundation of China: 61572139","National Science Foundation: IIS-1553568","National Science Foundation: 1U54GM114838","National Natural Science Foundation of China: 61422309","National Natural Science Foundation of China: 61379092"],"repoOwner":"sm-harding","repoName":"The Lemur Project","suggestName":"The Lemur Project","domains":["Biomedical","Metabolomics","Proteomics"],"publicationDOI":["10.1093\/bioinformatics\/btv237","10.1093\/bioinformatics\/btw294","10.1093\/bioinformatics\/btw244"],"tags":["mesh indexing","indexers","meshlabeler","citations","tfidf","meshs","representations","drug interaction prediction","predictive","methods","interactions","drugs","rankings","targeted"],"dateUpdated":Tue Jul 11 06:53:55 PDT 2017,"institutions":["School of Information Science & Engineering Central South University","Bioinformatics Center Institute for Chemical Research Kyoto University","Department of Computer Science University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign","Department of Computer Science University of Virginia","School of Computer Science and Shanghai Key Lab of Intelligent Information Processing Fudan University","National Center for Mathematics and Interdisciplinary Sciences Academy of Mathematics and Systems Science Chinese Academy of Sciences"],"license":"BSD License","_version_":1572661033705668608,"name":"The Lemur Project","suggestNamePrefix":"The Lemur Project","authorEmails":null,"authors":["Ke Liu","Shengwen Peng","Junqiu Wu","Chengxiang Zhai","Hiroshi Mamitsuka","Shanfeng Zhu","Ronghui You","Hongning Wang","Qingjun Yuan","Junning Gao","Dongliang Wu","Shihua Zhang"]},{"fundingAgencies":["COST"],"repoDescription":"The R453Plus1 Toolbox comprises useful functions for the analysis of data generated by Roche's 454 sequencing platform.

However, to our knowledge, there is no statistical procedure designed to detect specific patterns of association with multiple endpoint variables.\n        Results: Projection onto the most interesting statistical evidence (PROMISE) is proposed as a general procedure to identify genomic variables that exhibit a specific biologically interesting pattern of association with multiple endpoint variables. Biological knowledge of the endpoint variables is used to define a vector that represents the biologically most interesting values for statistics that characterize the associations of the endpoint variables with a genomic variable. A test statistic is defined as the dot-product of the vector of the observed association statistics and the vector of the most interesting values of the association statistics. By definition, this test statistic is proportional to the length of the projection of the observed vector of correlations onto the vector of most interesting associations. Statistical significance is determined via permutation. In simulation studies and an example application, PROMISE shows greater statistical power to identify genes with the interesting pattern of associations than classical multivariate procedures, individual endpoint analyses or listing genes that have the pattern of interest and are significant in more than one individual endpoint analysis.\n        Availability: Documented R routines are freely available from www.stjuderesearch.org\/depts\/biostats and will soon be available as a Bioconductor package from www.bioconductor.org.\n        Contact: stanley.pounds@stjude.org\n        Supplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.","language":["R"],"source":"PMC Extraction","repoUpdatedDate":Wed May 04 21:17:01 PDT 2016,"repoHomepage":"","platforms":["Linux (Unix)","Windows 32","Windows 64","Mac OS X 10.6","Mac OS X 10.9"],"linkDescriptions":null,"linkUrls":["http:\/\/bioconductor.org\/packages\/release\/bioc\/vignettes\/PROMISE\/inst\/doc\/PROMISE.pdf","http:\/\/bioconductor.org\/packages\/release\/bioc\/src\/contrib\/PROMISE_1.20.0.tar.gz","http:\/\/bioconductor.org\/packages\/release\/bioc\/html\/PROMISE.html"],"publicationReferences":[13],"dateCreated":Thu Jul 06 10:49:33 PDT 2017,"repoCreationDate":Fri Mar 27 07:13:25 PDT 2015,"suggestTag":["Gene Expression"],"suggestTagPrefix":["Gene Expression"],"id":11327,"repoDownloads":60,"publicationDate":["2009-06-15T00:00:00Z"],"repoForks":0,"codeRepoURL":"http:\/\/bioconductor.org\/packages\/release\/bioc\/html\/PROMISE.html","funding":["NIH: R01 CA132946","HHS: R01 CA132946","NCI: R01 CA132946","NIH: R01 CA132946-01","HHS: R01 CA132946-01","NCI: R01 CA132946-01","NIH: R01 CA132946-02","HHS: R01 CA132946-02","NCI: R01 CA132946-02","NIH: R01CA132946-01","HHS: R01CA132946-01","NCI: R01CA132946-01"],"types":["Tool"],"repoOwner":"Bioconductor-mirror","repoName":"PROMISE","suggestName":"PROMISE","publicationPMID":[19528086],"domains":["Statistics and Probability","Computational Theory and Mathematics","Biochemistry","Molecular Biology","Computational Mathematics","Computer Science Applications","Genomics"],"publicationTitle":["PROMISE: a tool to identify genomic features with a specific biologically interesting pattern of associations with multiple endpoint variables."],"publicationDOI":["10.1093\/bioinformatics\/btp357"],"dateUpdated":Fri Jul 07 02:11:17 PDT 2017,"tags":["Gene Expression","Microarray","OneChannel","MultipleComparison","GeneExpression"],"institutions":["St. Jude Children's Research Hospital","University of Minnesota"],"publicationJournal":["Bioinformatics"],"license":"GPL (>= 2)","_version_":1572223350413983744,"name":"PROMISE","suggestNamePrefix":"PROMISE","authorEmails":null,"authors":["Stan S Pounds","Cheng C Cheng","Xueyuan X Cao","Kristine R KR Crews","William W Plunkett","Varsha V Gandhi","Jeffrey J Rubnitz","Raul C RC Ribeiro","James R JR Downing","Jatinder J Lamba","Stan Pounds","Xueyuan Cao"]},{"repoDescription":"Graph objects from pathway topology derived from Biocarta, HumanCyc, KEGG, NCI, Panther, Reactome and SPIKE databases.","repo":"bioconductor","description":"graphite is package able to gather and make easily available the contents of the four major pathway databases.

Risa allows to access metadata\/data in ISA-Tab format and build Bioconductor data structures. Currently, data generated from microarray, flow cytometry and metabolomics-based (i.e. mass spectrometry) assays are supported. The package is extendable and efforts are undergoing to support metadata associated to proteomics assays.","repo":"bioconductor","description":"Background.: The ISA-Tab format and software suite have been developed to break the silo effect induced by technology-specific formats for a variety of data types and to better support experimental metadata tracking. Experimentalists seldom use a single technique to monitor biological signals. Providing a multipurpose , pragmatic and accessible format that abstracts away common constructs for describing Investigations, Studies and Assays, ISA is increasingly popular. To attract further interest towards the format and extend support to ensure reproducible research and reusable data, we present the Risa package, which delivers a central component to support the ISA format by enabling effortless integration with R, the popular, open source data crunching environment. Results.: The Risa package bridges the gap between the metadata collection and curation in an ISA-compliant way and the data analysis using the widely used statistical computing environment R. The package offers functionality for: i) parsing ISA-Tab datasets into R objects, ii) augmenting annotation with extra metadata not explicitly stated in the ISA syntax; iii) interfacing with domain specific R packages iv) suggesting potentially useful R packages available in Bioconductor for subsequent processing of the experimental data described in the ISA format; and finally v) saving back to ISA-Tab files augmented with analysis specific metadata from R. We demonstrate these features by presenting use cases for mass spectrometry data and DNA microarray data. Conclusions.: The Risa package is open source (with LGPL license) and freely available through Bioconductor. By making Risa available, we aim to facilitate the task of processing experimental data, encouraging a uniform representation of experimental information and results while delivering tools for ensuring traceability and provenance tracking. Software availability.: The Risa package is available since Bioconductor 2.11 (version 1.0.0) and version 1.2.1 appeared in Bioconductor 2.12, both along with documentation and examples. The latest version of the code is at the development branch in Bioconductor and can also be accessed from GitHub https:\/\/github.com\/ISA-tools\/Risa, where the issue tracker allows users to report bugs or feature requests.","language":["R"],"source":"Migration","repoUpdatedDate":Tue Oct 11 01:52:38 PDT 2016,"platforms":["Linux (Unix)","Windows 32","Windows 64","Mac OS X 10.6","Mac OS X

The main issues are as follows: (i) statistical significance of inferring peptide from experimental mass spectra must be platform independent and spectrum specific and (ii) individual spectrum matches at the peptide level must be combined into a single statistical measure at the protein level. Results: We present a method and software to assign statistical significance to protein identifications from search engines for mass spectrometric data. The approach is based on asymptotic theory of order statistics. The parameters of the asymptotic distributions of identification scores are estimated for each spectrum individually. The method relies on new unbiased estimators for parameters of extreme value distribution. The estimated parameters are used to assign a spectrum-specific P-value to each peptide-spectrum match. The protein-level confidence measure combines P-values of peptide-to-spectrum matches. Conclusion: We extensively tested the method using triplicate mouse and yeast high-throughput proteomic experiments. The proposed statistical approach improves the sensitivity of protein identifications without compromising specificity. While the method was primarily designed to work with Mascot, it is platform-independent and is applicable to any search engine which outputs a single score for a peptide-spectrum match. We demonstrate this by testing the method in conjunction with X!Tandem.","source":"Grobid Extraction: Bioinformatics","inputFiles":["PeptideProphet or iProphet results"],"repoUpdatedDate":Sun Feb 01 19:18:01 PST 2015,"repoHomepage":"http:\/\/proteinprophet.sourceforge.net","linkDescriptions":null,"linkUrls":["","http:\/\/tools.proteomecenter.org\/wiki\/index.php?title=TPP_Tutorial#10._Protein-level_validation_with_ProteinProphet","http:\/\/proteinprophet.sourceforge.net\/","http:\/\/bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org","http:\/\/proteinprophet.sourceforge.net\/.For"],"dateCreated":Thu Feb 24 17:38:20 PST 2011,"repoCreationDate":Wed Jun 18 17:00:00 PDT 2003,"suggestTag":["scoring","proteins","peptides","identifications","values","databases"],"suggestTagPrefix":["scoring","proteins","peptides","identifications","values","databases"],"id":11363,"repoDownloads":0,"repoForks":0,"codeRepoURL":"proteinprophet.sourceforge.net","types":["Tool"],"funding":["Genomes to Life Grant DE-FG08-01ER6321:Genomes to Life Grant DE-FG08-01ER6321","NHLBI N01-HV-28179: NCI 1-R33-CA93302","National Institute of Health: DE019022"],"repoOwner":"eng_jk","repoName":"ProteinProphet","suggestName":"ProteinProphet","domains":["Proteomics","Epigenomics"],"publicationDOI":["10.1021\/ac0341261","10.1093\/bioinformatics\/btr089"],"dateUpdated":Fri Jul 07 02:23:37 PDT 2017,"tags":["scoring","proteins","peptides","identifications","values","databases"],"institutions":["Institute for Systems Biology","MPI of Molecular Cell Biology and Genetics","Division of Genetics Brigham and Women's Hospital Harvard Medical School","Department of Cell Biology Harvard Medical School"],"license":"No License","_version_":1572285181531783168,"name":"ProteinProphet","suggestNamePrefix":"ProteinProphet","authorEmails":null,"authors":["Alexey I.

Tandem Repeats (TRs) constitute a large class of repetitive sequences that are originated via phenomena such as replication slippage and are characterized by close spatial contiguity. They play an important role in several molecular regulatory mechanisms, and also in several diseases (e.g. in the group of trinucleotide repeat disorders). While for TRs with a low or medium level of divergence the current methods are rather effective, the problem of detecting TRs with higher divergence (fuzzy TRs) is still open. The detection of fuzzy TRs is propaedeutic to enriching our view of their role in regulatory mechanisms and diseases. Fuzzy TRs are also important as tools to shed light on the evolutionary history of the genome, where higher divergence correlates with more remote duplication events. Results: We have developed an algorithm (christened TRStalker) with the aim of detecting efficiently TRs that are hard to detect because of their inherent fuzziness, due to high levels of base substitutions, insertions and deletions. To attain this goal, we developed heuristics to solve a Steiner version of the problem for which the fuzziness is measured with respect to a motif string not necessarily present in the input string.

However, calling mutations at this range is still confounded by many factors including environmental contamination. Vector contamination is a continuously occurring issue and is especially problematic since vector inserts are hardly distinguishable from the sample sequences. Such inserts, which may harbor polymorphisms and engineered functional mutations, can result in calling false variants at corresponding sites. Numerous vector-screening methods have been developed, but none could handle contamination from inserts because they are focusing on vector backbone sequences alone. Results: We developed a novel methodâ\u0080\u0094Vecuumâ\u0080\u0094that identifies vector-originated reads and resultant false variants. Since vector inserts are generally constructed from intron-less cDNAs, Vecuum identifies vector-originated reads by inspecting the clipping patterns at exon junctions. False variant calls are further detected based on the biased distribution of mutant alleles to vector-originated reads. Tests on simulated and spike-in experimental data validated that Vecuum could detect 93% of vector contaminants and could remove up to 87% of variant-like false calls with 100% precision. Application to public sequence datasets demonstrated the utility of Vecuum in detecting false variants resulting from various types of external contamination.

Usually the data will be gene expression values from array-based or sequence-based experiments, but data from other types of experiments can also be analyzed (e.g. copy number variation). Traditional methods like Significance Analysis of Microarrays (SAM) and Linear Models for Microarray Data (LIMMA) use significance tests based on summary statistics (mean and standard deviation) of the distributions. This approach lacks power to identify expression differences between groups that show high levels of intra-group heterogeneity. The Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) algorithm instead computes the \"work\" needed to transform one distribution into another, thus providing a metric of the overall difference in shape between two distributions. Permutation of sample labels is used to generate q-values for the observed EMD scores. This package also incorporates the Komolgorov-Smirnov (K-S) test and the Cramer von Mises test (CVM), which are both common distribution comparison tests.","repo":"bioconductor","description":"A major goal of biomedical research is to identify molecular features associated with a biological or clinical class of interest. Differential expression analysis has long been used for this purpose; however, conventional methods perform poorly when applied to data with high within class heterogeneity.\n                To address this challenge, we developed EMDomics, a new method that uses the Earth mover's distance to measure the overall difference between the distributions of a gene's expression in two classes of samples and uses permutations to obtain q-values for each gene. We applied EMDomics to the challenging problem of identifying genes associated with drug resistance in ovarian cancer. We also used simulated data to evaluate the performance of EMDomics, in terms of sensitivity and specificity for identifying differentially expressed gene in classes with high within class heterogeneity. In both the simulated and real biological data, EMDomics outperformed competing approaches for the identification of differentially expressed genes, and EMDomics was significantly more powerful than conventional methods for the identification of drug resistance-associated gene sets. EMDomics represents a new approach for the identification of genes differentially expressed between heterogeneous classes and has utility in a wide range of complex biomedical conditions in which sample classes show within class heterogeneity.\n                The R package is available at http:\/\/www.bioconductor.org\/packages\/release\/bioc\/html\/EMDomics.html.\n                Â© The Author 2015.

While there are many existing methods for detecting SVs, finding deletions is still challenging with low-coverage short sequence reads. Existing deletion finding methods for sequence reads either use the so-called split reads mapping for detecting deletions with exact breakpoints, or rely on discordant insert sizes to estimate approximate positions of deletions. Neither is completely satisfactory with low-coverage sequence reads. Results: We present SVseq, an efficient two-stage approach, which combines the split reads mapping and discordant insert size analysis. The first stage is split reads mapping based on the Burrowsâ\u0080\u0093 Wheeler transform (BWT), which finds candidate deletions. Our split reads mapping method allows mismatches and small indels, thus deletions near other small variations can be discovered and reads with sequencing errors can be utilized. The second stage filters the false positives by analyzing discordant insert sizes.

Most of the existing mapping programs do not model homopolymer errors when aligning reads against the reference. The resulting alignments will then contain various kinds of mismatches and indels that confound the accurate determination of variant loci and alleles. Results: To address these challenges, we realign reads against the reference using our previously proposed hidden Markov model that models homopolymer errors and then merges these pairwise alignments into a weighted alignment graph. Based on our weighted alignment graph and hidden Markov model, we develop a method called PyroHMMvar, which can simultaneously detect short indels and SNPs, as demonstrated in human resequencing data. Specifically, by applying our methods to simulated diploid datasets, we demonstrate that PyroHMMvar produces more accurate results than state-of-the-art methods, such as Samtools and GATK, and is less sensitive to mapping parameter settings than the other methods. We also apply PyroHMMvar to analyze one human whole genome resequencing dataset, and the results confirm that PyroHMMvar predicts SNPs and indels accurately.

Deletions, an important type of SVs, have been suggested in association with genetic diseases. There are three types of deletions: blunt deletions , deletions with microhomologies and deletions with microsinsertions. The last two types are very common in the human genome, but they pose difficulty for the detection. Furthermore, finding deletions from sequencing data remains challenging. It is highly appealing to develop sensitive and accurate methods to detect deletions from sequencing data, especially deletions with microho-mology and deletions with microinsertion. Results: We present a novel method called Sprites (SPlit Read realIgnment To dEtect Structural variants) which finds deletions from sequencing data. It aligns a whole soft-clipping read rather than its clipped part to the target sequence, a segment of the reference which is determined by spanning reads, in order to find the longest prefix or suffix of the read that has a match in the target sequence. This alignment aims to solve the problem of deletions with microhomologies and deletions with microinsertions. Using both simulated and real data we show that Sprites performs better on detecting deletions compared with other current methods in terms of F-score.

Peptides, which partially mimic the interface area of one of the interacting proteins, are natural candidates to form proteinâ\u0080\u0093peptide complexes competing with the original PPI. The prediction of such complexes is especially challenging due to the high flexibility of peptide conformations. Results: In this article, we present PepCrawler, a new tool for deriving binding peptides from proteinâ\u0080\u0093protein complexes and prediction of peptideâ\u0080\u0093protein complexes, by performing high-resolution docking refinement and estimation of binding affinity. By using a fast path planning approach, PepCrawler rapidly generates large amounts of flexible peptide conformations, allowing backbone and side chain flexibility. A newly introduced binding energy funnel 'steepness score' was applied for the evaluation of the proteinâ\u0080\u0093peptide complexes binding affinity. PepCrawler simulations predicted high binding affinity for native proteinâ\u0080\u0093peptide complexes benchmark and low affinity for low-energy decoy complexes. In three cases, where wet lab data are available, the PepCrawler predictions were consistent with the data. Comparing to other state of the art flexible peptideâ\u0080\u0093protein structure prediction algorithms, our algorithm is very fast, and takes only minutes to run on a single PC.","language":["Python"],"source":"Grobid Extraction: Bioinformatics","repoUpdatedDate":Tue Apr 04 15:00:03 PDT 2017,"repoHomepage":"http:\/\/matplotlib.org\/","linkDescriptions":null,"platforms":["WIndow,Mac OS X,Linux",""],"linkUrls":["http:\/\/rubyonrails.org","http:\/\/jquery.com","http:\/\/www.scipy.org","http:\/\/protovis.org","http:\/\/fancybox.net).Interactive","http:\/\/bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org","http:\/\/matplotlib.sourceforge.net","http:\/\/sherekhan.bionmr.org.Contact","http:\/\/bioinfo3d.cs.tau.ac.il\/PepCrawler\/Contact","http:\/\/matplotlib.sourceforge.net).Funding","https:\/\/github.com\/matplotlib\/matplotlib"],"dateCreated":Thu Sep 01 04:03:12 PDT 2011,"suggestTag":["conformational","peptidic","energies","binding","proteins","complexes"],"suggestTagPrefix":["conformational","peptidic","energies","binding","proteins","complexes"],"repoCreationDate":Wed May 07 17:00:00 PDT 2003,"id":11393,"repoDownloads":0,"repoForks":0,"codeRepoURL":"matplotlib.sourceforge.net","funding":["Israel Science Foundation: 1403\/09"],"types":["Tool"],"repoOwner":"ianthomas23","repoName":"matplotlib","suggestName":"matplotlib","domains":["Biomedical","Proteomics"],"publicationDOI":["10.1093\/bioinformatics\/btt286","10.1093\/bioinformatics\/btr498"],"tags":["sherekhan exchange","resonance","http","exchanges","conformational","peptidic","energies","binding","proteins","complexes"],"dateUpdated":Fri Jul 07 02:17:11 PDT 2017,"institutions":["Department of NMR-based Structural Biology Max-Planck-Institute for Biophysical Chemistry","Blavatnik School of Computer Science Tel Aviv University"],"license":"Python Software Foundation License","_version_":1572284738875424768,"name":"matplotlib","suggestNamePrefix":"matplotlib","authorEmails":null,"authors":["Adam Mazur","BjÃ¶ Rn Hammesfahr","Christian Griesinger","Donghan Lee","Martin Kollmar","Elad Donsky","Haim J Wolfson"]},{"types":["Tool"],"suggestName":"supermatcherService","description":"Finds a match of a large sequence against one or more sequences\r\n","source":"BioCatalogue","platforms":["SOAP WS","SOAP"],"tags":["Sequence analysis","alignment local","Sequence Analysis"],"dateUpdated":Mon Nov 09 21:01:59 PST 2015,"linkDescriptions":null,"linkUrls":["http:\/\/genius.embnet.dkfz-heidelberg.de\/menu\/hobit\/embdoc\/supermatcher.html","https:\/\/www.biocatalogue.org\/services\/3654","http:\/\/genius.embnet.dkfz-heidelberg.de\/menu\/hobit\/embapps\/wsdl\/supermatcher.wsdl","http:\/\/www.dkfz-heidelberg.de\/menu\/tomcat\/as\/alignment_local.supermatcher.derived"],"institutions":["German Cancer Research Center"],"dateCreated":Mon Nov 09 21:01:59 PST 2015,"suggestTag":["alignment local","Sequence Analysis"],"suggestTagPrefix":["alignment local","Sequence Analysis"],"_version_":1572282249336848384,"name":"supermatcherService","suggestNamePrefix":"supermatcherService","id":11394},{"types":["Tool","Database"],"suggestName":"wsPrediction","domains":["Metabolomics"],"description":"\nThese web services provide access to methods for prediction of chemical sub-groups by means of user submitted mass spectra.\nPlease send all feedback to hummel@mpimp-golm.mpg.de","source":"BioCatalogue","platforms":["SOAP","SOAP WS"],"tags":["cheminformatics","Metabolomics","mass spectrometry","gas chromatography","GC-MS","Data Retrieval","Chemoinformatics","Cheminformatics","Information retrieval"],"dateUpdated":Mon Nov 09 21:01:59 PST 2015,"linkDescriptions":null,"institutions":["Max Planck Institute of Molecular Plant Physiology"],"linkUrls":["https:\/\/www.biocatalogue.org\/services\/2633","http:\/\/gmd.mpimp-golm.mpg.de\/webservices\/wsPrediction.asmx","http:\/\/gmd.mpimp-golm.mpg.de\/webservices\/wsPrediction.asmx?WSDL"],"dateCreated":Mon Nov 09 21:01:59 PST 2015,"suggestTag":["cheminformatics","Metabolomics","mass spectrometry","gas chromatography","GC-MS","Data Retrieval","Chemoinformatics"],"suggestTagPrefix":["cheminformatics","Metabolomics","mass spectrometry","gas chromatography","GC-MS","Data Retrieval","Chemoinformatics"],"_version_":1572281976184897536,"name":"wsPrediction","suggestNamePrefix":"wsPrediction","id":11395},{"types":["Tool","Database"],"suggestName":"QueryService","domains":["Biomedical"],"description":"The Ontology Lookup Service is a spin-off of the PRIDE project, which required a centralized query interface for ontology and controlled vocabulary lookup.

Our extensions go in several directions: we show how prior assumptions on the network structure can be incorporated into the scoring scheme by defining appropriate prior distributions on the network structure as well as on hyperparameters. An approach called module networks is introduced to scale up the original approach, which is limited to around 5 genes, to infer large-scale networks of more than 30 genes. Instead of the data discretization step needed in the original framework, we propose the usage of a beta-uniform mixture distribution on the P-value profile, resulting from differential gene expression calculation, to quantify effects. Extensive simulations on artificial data and application of our module network approach to infer the signaling network between 13 genes in the ER-α pathway in human MCF-7 breast cancer cells show that our approach gives sensible results. Using a bootstrapping and a jackknife approach, this reconstruction is found to be statistically stable.\n        Availability: The proposed method is available within the Bioconductor R-package nem.\n        Contact: h.froehlich@dkfz-heidelberg.de","language":["R"],"source":"PMC Extraction","repoUpdatedDate":Sun Jan 29 09:58:01 PST 2017,"repoHomepage":"","platforms":["Linux (Unix)","Windows 32","Windows 64","Mac OS X 10.6","Mac OS X 10.9"],"linkDescriptions":null,"emails":["h.froehlich@dkfz-heidelberg.de"],"linkUrls":["http:\/\/bioconductor.org\/packages\/release\/bioc\/vignettes\/nem\/inst\/doc\/markowetz-thesis-2006.pdf,","http:\/\/bioconductor.org\/packages\/release\/bioc\/vignettes\/nem\/inst\/doc\/nem.pdf","http:\/\/bioconductor.org\/packages\/release\/bioc\/src\/contrib\/nem_2.42.0.tar.gz","http:\/\/bioconductor.org\/packages\/release\/bioc\/html\/nem.html"],"publicationReferences":[8],"dateCreated":Thu Jul 06 10:42:58 PDT 2017,"repoCreationDate":Fri Mar 27 09:56:30 PDT 2015,"suggestTag":["Systems Biology"],"suggestTagPrefix":["Systems Biology"],"id":11406,"repoDownloads":149,"publicationDate":["2008-01-28T00:00:00Z"],"repoForks":2,"codeRepoURL":"http:\/\/bioconductor.org\/packages\/release\/bioc\/html\/nem.html","funding":["Federal Ministry of Education and Research: Grant not found","BMBF: Grant not found"],"types":["Tool"],"repoOwner":"Bioconductor-mirror","repoName":"nem","suggestName":"nem","publicationPMID":[18227117],"domains":["Statistics and Probability","Computational Theory and Mathematics","Biochemistry","Molecular Biology","Computational Mathematics","Computer Science Applications","Genomics"],"publicationTitle":["Estimating large-scale signaling networks through nested effect models with intervention effects from microarray data."],"publicationDOI":["10.1093\/bioinformatics\/btm634"],"dateUpdated":Fri Jul 07 02:15:32 PDT 2017,"tags":["Systems Biology","Microarray","Bioinformatics","GraphsAndNetworks","Pathways","SystemsBiology","NetworkInference"],"publicationJournal":["Bioinformatics"],"license":"GPL (>= 2)","_version_":1572223057623252992,"name":"nem","suggestNamePrefix":"nem","authorEmails":null,"authors":["Holger H FrÃ¶hlich","Mark M Fellmann","Holger H SÃ¼ltmann","Annemarie A Poustka","Tim T Beissbarth","Holger Froehlich","Florian Markowetz","Achim Tresch","Theresa Niederberger","Christian Bender","Matthias Maneck","Claudio Lottaz","Tim Beissbarth"]},{"types":["Tool","Database"],"suggestName":"EMMAWebService","description":"The EMMA 2 software has been designed to resolve shortcomings with respect to full MAGE-ML and ontology support and makes use of modern data integration techniques.

Bayesian methods provide natural modeling frameworks for analyzing eQTL studies, where information shared across markers and\/or genes can increase the power to detect eQTLs. Bayesian approaches tend to be computationally demanding and require specialized software. As a result, most eQTL studies use univariate methods treating each gene independently, leading to suboptimal results.\n        Results: We present a powerful, computationally optimized and free open-source R package, iBMQ. Our package implements a joint hierarchical Bayesian model where all genes and SNPs are modeled concurrently. Model parameters are estimated using a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm. The free and widely used openMP parallel library speeds up computation. Using a mouse cardiac dataset, we show that iBMQ improves the detection of large trans-eQTL hotspots compared with other state-of-the-art packages for eQTL analysis.\n        Availability: The R-package iBMQ is available from the Bioconductor Web site at http:\/\/bioconductor.org and runs on Linux, Windows and MAC OS X.

association studies (GWAS) are used to discover genes underlying complex, heritable disorders for which less powerful study designs have failed in the past. The number of GWAS has skyrocketed recently with findings reported in top journals and the mainstream media. Microarrays are the genotype calling technology of choice in GWAS as they permit exploration of more than a million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) simultaneously. The starting point for the statistical analyses used by GWAS to determine association between loci and disease is making genotype calls (AA, AB or BB). However, the raw data, microarray probe intensities, are heavily processed before arriving at these calls. Various sophisticated statistical procedures have been proposed for transforming raw data into genotype calls. We find that variability in microarray output quality across different SNPs, different arrays and different sample batches have substantial influence on the accuracy of genotype calls made by existing algorithms. Failure to account for these sources of variability can adversely affect the quality of findings reported by the GWAS.\n        Results: We developed a method based on an enhanced version of the multi-level model used by CRLMM version 1. Two key differences are that we now account for variability across batches and improve the call-specific assessment of each call. The new model permits the development of quality metrics for SNPs, samples and batches of samples. Using three independent datasets, we demonstrate that the CRLMM version 2 outperforms CRLMM version 1 and the algorithm provided by Affymetrix, Birdseed. The main advantage of the new approach is that it enables the identification of low-quality SNPs, samples and batches.\n        Availability: Software implementing of the method described in this

provides a modular and extensible set of open-source, cross-platform tools and libraries. The tools perform proteomics data analyses; the libraries enable rapid tool creation by providing a robust, pluggable development framework that simplifies and unifies data file access, and performs standard proteomics and LCMS dataset computations. The library contains readers and writers of the mzML data format, which has been written using modern C++ techniques and design principles and supports a variety of platforms with native compilers. The software has been specifically released under the Apache v2 license to ensure it can be used in both academic and commercial projects. In addition to the library, we also introduce a rapidly growing set of companion tools whose implementation helps to illustrate the simplicity of developing applications on top of the ProteoWizard library.\n        Availability: Cross-platform software that compiles using native compilers (i.e. GCC on Linux, MSVC on Windows and XCode on OSX) is available for download free of charge, at http:\/\/proteowizard.sourceforge.net. This website also provides code examples, and documentation. It is our hope the ProteoWizard project will become a standard platform for proteomics development; consequently, code use, contribution and further development are strongly encouraged.\n        Contact: darren@proteowizard.org; parag@ucla.edu\n        Supplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.","language":["C#"],"source":"PMC Extraction","repoUpdatedDate":Thu Jul 06 10:10:59 PDT 2017,"repoHomepage":"http:\/\/proteowizard.sourceforge.net","linkDescriptions":null,"linkUrls":["http:\/\/proteowizard.sourceforge.net"],"publicationReferences":[5],"dateCreated":Thu Jul 06 10:43:45 PDT 2017,"repoCreationDate":Mon Feb 04 16:00:00 PST 2008,"suggestTag":["Genome Analysis"],"suggestTagPrefix":["Genome Analysis"],"id":11420,"repoDownloads":0,"publicationDate":["2008-07-07T00:00:00Z"],"repoForks":0,"codeRepoURL":"proteowizard.sourceforge.net","funding":["NIH: R01 CA126218","HHS: R01 CA126218","NCI: R01 CA126218","NIH: U24 CA126479","HHS: U24 CA126479","NCI: U24 CA126479","NIH: P41 GM103493","NIGMS: P41 GM103493","HHS: P41 GM103493","NIH: GM103493","NIGMS: GM103493","HHS: GM103493","NIH: U24 CA159988","HHS: U24 CA159988","NCI: U24 CA159988"],"repoOwner":"mhorowitzgelb","repoName":"ProteoWizard","suggestName":"ProteoWizard","publicationPMID":[18606607],"domains":["Statistics and Probability","Computational Theory and Mathematics","Biochemistry","Molecular Biology","Computational Mathematics","Computer Science Applications"],"publicationTitle":["ProteoWizard: open source software for rapid proteomics tools development."],"publicationDOI":["10.1093\/bioinformatics\/btn323","10.1093\/bioinformatics\/btv437"],"dateUpdated":Thu Jul 06 10:48:36 PDT 2017,"tags":["Genome Analysis","Algorithms","Calibration","Chromatography, Liquid","Cluster Analysis","Humans","Information Storage and Retrieval","Mass Spectrometry","Peptide Fragments","Proteins","Proteome","Proteomics","Software"],"institutions":["Vanderbilt University","University of California, San Francisco","Pacific Northwest National Laboratory","Vanderbilt University School of Medicine"],"publicationJournal":["Bioinformatics"],"license":"Apache License V2.0","_version_":1572223099103870976,"name":"ProteoWizard","suggestNamePrefix":"ProteoWizard","authorEmails":null,"authors":["Darren D Kessner","Matt M Chambers","Robert R Burke","David D Agus","Parag P Mallick","Bryson C BC Gibbons","Matthew C MC Chambers","Matthew E ME Monroe","David L DL Tabb","Samuel H SH Payne"]},{"funding":["ANR: ANR-13-BSV7-0017","GRF: 172099\/14"],"fundingAgencies":["ANR"],"suggestName":"github","description":"Motivation: Environmental dissemination of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) has become an increasing concern for public health. Metagenomics approaches can effectively detect broad profiles of ARGs in environmental samples; however, the detection and subsequent classification of ARG-like sequences are time consuming and have been severe obstacles in employing metagenomic methods. We sought to accelerate quantification of ARGs in metagenomic data from environmental samples. Results: A Structured ARG reference database (SARG) was constructed by integrating ARDB and CARD, the two most commonly used databases. SARG was curated to remove redundant sequences and optimized to facilitate query sequence identification by similarity. A database with a hierarchical structure (type-subtype-reference sequence) was then constructed to facilitate classification (assigning ARG-like sequence to type, subtype and reference sequence) of sequences identified through similarity search. Utilizing SARG and a previously proposed hybrid functional gene annotation pipeline, we developed an online pipeline called ARGs-OAP for fast annotation and classification of ARG-like sequences from metagenomic data. We also evaluated and proposed a set of criteria important for efficiently conducting metagenomic analysis of ARGs using ARGs-OAP.

One way is to approach this problem sitewise, i.e. to find differentially methylated positions (DMPs). However, it has been shown that methylation is regulated in longer genomic regions. So it is more desirable to identify differentially methylated regions (DMRs) instead of DMPs. The new high coverage arrays, like Illuminas 450k platform, make it possible at a reasonable cost. Few tools exist for DMR identification from this type of data, but there is no standard approach.\n        Results: We propose a novel method for DMR identification that detects the region boundaries according to the minimum description length (MDL) principle, essentially solving the problem of model selection. The significance of the regions is established using linear mixed models. Using both simulated and large publicly available methylation datasets, we compare seqlm performance to alternative approaches. We demonstrate that it is both more sensitive and specific than competing methods. This is achieved with minimal parameter tuning and, surprisingly, quickest running time of all the tried methods. Finally, we show that the regional differential methylation patterns identified on sparse array data are confirmed by higher resolution sequencing approaches.\n        Availability and Implementation:

way.","repo":"sourceforge","description":"Motivation: The enormous amount of short reads generated by the new DNA sequencing technologies call for the development of fast and accurate read alignment programs. A first generation of hash table-based methods has been developed, including MAQ, which is accurate, feature rich and fast enough to align short reads from a single individual. However, MAQ does not support gapped alignment for single-end reads, which makes it unsuitable for alignment of longer reads where indels may occur frequently. The speed of MAQ is also a concern when the alignment is scaled up to the resequencing of hundreds of individuals.\n        Results: We implemented Burrows-Wheeler Alignment tool (BWA), a new read alignment package that is based on backward search with Burrows\u2013Wheeler Transform (BWT), to efficiently align short sequencing reads against a large reference sequence such as the human genome, allowing mismatches and gaps. BWA supports both base space reads, e.g. from Illumina sequencing machines, and color space reads from AB SOLiD machines. Evaluations on both simulated and real data suggest that BWA is ∼10\u201320× faster than MAQ, while achieving similar accuracy. In addition, BWA outputs alignment in the new standard SAM (Sequence Alignment\/Map) format. Variant calling and other downstream analyses after the alignment can be achieved with the open source SAMtools software package.\n        Availability: http:\/\/maq.sourceforge.net\n        Contact: rd@sanger.ac.uk","language":["Perl"],"source":"PMC Extraction","repoUpdatedDate":Wed Jan 07 03:53:25 PST 2015,"repoHomepage":"http:\/\/maq.sourceforge.net","linkDescriptions":null,"linkUrls":["http:\/\/bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org","http:\/\/rrbsmap.computational-epigenetics.org\/http:\/\/code.google.com\/p\/bsmap\/Contact","http:\/\/maq.sourceforge.net","http:\/\/cran.r-project.org","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/Traces\/sra","http:\/\/bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk\/projects\/fastqc"],"dateCreated":Thu Jul 06 10:43:33 PDT 2017,"suggestTag":["Sequence Analysis"],"suggestTagPrefix":["Sequence Analysis"],"repoCreationDate":Tue Mar 20 17:00:00 PDT 2007,"id":11430,"repoDownloads":0,"repoForks":0,"codeRepoURL":"maq.sourceforge.net","funding":["Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas: U01DA025956","Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas: RP110471-C3","National Institutes of Health: U01ES017155","Wellcome Trust: 077192\/Z\/05\/Z"],"repoOwner":"ruanjue","repoName":"Mapping and Assembly with Qualities","suggestName":"Mapping and Assembly with Qualities","domains":["Epigenomics","Metagenomics","Statistics and Probability","Computational Theory and Mathematics","Biochemistry","Molecular Biology","Computational Mathematics","Computer Science Applications"],"publicationDOI":["10.1093\/bioinformatics\/btr668","10.1093\/bioinformatics\/btv070","10.1093\/bioinformatics\/btp324"],"tags":["sequencing","alignments","genomes","rrbsmap","bioinformatics","sequencing data","copy number","sequenced","genomics","copies","numbers","Sequence Analysis"],"dateUpdated":Fri Jul 07 02:12:30 PDT 2017,"institutions":["Division of Biostatistics Dan L Duncan Cancer Center Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology Baylor College of Medicine","Department of Chemistry, Biotechnology and Food Science Norwegian University of Life Sciences (NMBU)","Division of Epidemiology Norwegian Institute of Public Health","Section for Biostatistics and Epidemiology Norwegian University of Life Sciences (NMBU)","Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute"],"license":"GNU General Public License version 2.0 (GPLv2)","_version_":1572283805926948864,"name":"Mapping and Assembly with Qualities","suggestNamePrefix":"Mapping and Assembly with Qualities","authorEmails":null,"authors":["Yuanxin Xi","Christoph Bock","Fabian MÃ¼ller","Deqiang Sun","Alexander Meissner","Wei Li","Alex Bateman","Ola Brynildsrud","Lars-Gustav Snipen","Jon Bohlin","Heng H Li","Richard R Durbin"]},{"types":["Tool","Database"],"duplicateWith":[5367,6001,6097],"suggestName":"Hogenom","domains":["Genomics","Proteomics"],"description":"Homologous genes from fully sequenced organisms.

However, the most popular normalization approaches do not utilize what is known about the study, both in terms of the biological variables of interest and the known technical factors in the study, such as batch or array processing date.\n        Results: We show here that failing to include all study-specific biological and technical variables when performing normalization leads to biased downstream analyses.

Strand-specific reads allow for detection of antisense events and a higher resolution of expression profiles enabling extension of current transcript annotations. However, applications making use of this strandedness information are still scarce. Results: Here we present a tool (Janus), which focuses on the identification of transcriptional active regions in antisense orientation to known and novel transcribed elements of the genome. Janus can compare the antisense events of multiple samples and assigns scores to identify mutual expression of either transcript in a sense\/ antisense pair, which could hint to regulatory mechanisms. Janus is able to make use of single-nucleotide variant (SNV) and methylation data, if available, and reports the sense to antisense ratio of regions in the vicinity of the identified genetic and epigenetic variation. Janus interrogates positions of heterozygous SNVs to identify strand-specific allelic imbalance.

As a result, most of the current bioinformatics tools become obsolete as they fail to scale with data. To tackle this 'data deluge', here we introduce the BioPig sequence analysis toolkit as one of the solutions that scale to data and computation. Results: We built BioPig on the Apache's Hadoop MapReduce system and the Pig data flow language. Compared with traditional serial and MPI-based algorithms, BioPig has three major advantages: first, BioPig's programmability greatly reduces development time for parallel bioinformatics applications; second, testing BioPig with up to 500 Gb sequences demonstrates that it scales automatically with size of data; and finally, BioPig can be ported without modification on many Hadoop infrastructures, as tested with Magellan system at National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center and the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud. In summary, BioPig represents a novel program framework with the potential to greatly accelerate data-intensive bioinformatics analysis.

However, analysis tools are severely lacking. Although high-throughput systems allow rapid data collection from large cohorts, manual data analysis can take months. Moreover, identification of cell populations can be subjective and analysts rarely examine the entirety of the multidimensional dataset (focusing instead on a limited number of subsets, the biology of which has usually already been well-described). Thus, the value of PFC as a discovery tool is largely wasted.\n        Results: To address this problem, we developed a computational approach that automatically reveals all possible cell subsets. From tens of thousands of subsets, those that correlate strongly with clinical outcome are selected and grouped. Within each group, markers that have minimal relevance to the biological outcome are removed, thereby distilling the complex dataset into the simplest, most clinically relevant subsets. This allows complex information from PFC studies to be translated into clinical or resource-poor settings, where multiparametric analysis is less feasible. We demonstrate the utility of this approach in a large (n=466), retrospective, 14-parameter PFC study of early HIV infection, where we identify three T-cell subsets that strongly predict progression to AIDS (only one of which was identified by an initial manual analysis).\n        Availability: The \u2018flowType: Phenotyping Multivariate PFC Assays\u2019 package is available through Bioconductor.

In order to detect driver genes, several samples need to be simultaneously analyzed. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project provides access to a large amount of data for several cancer types. TGCA is an invaluable source of information , but analysis of this huge dataset possess important computational problems in terms of memory and execution times. Here, we present a R\/package, called VegaMC (Vega multi-channel), that enables fast and efficient detection of significant recurrent copy number alterations in very large datasets. VegaMC is integrated with the output of the common tools that convert allele signal intensities in log R ratio and B allele frequency. It also enables the detection of loss of hetero-zigosity and provides in output two web pages allowing a rapid and easy navigation of the aberrant genes. Synthetic data and real data-sets are used for quantitative and qualitative evaluation purposes. In particular, we demonstrate the ability of VegaMC on two large TGCA datasets: colon adenocarcinoma and glioblastoma multiforme. For both the datasets, we provide the list of aberrant genes which contain previously validated genes and can be used as basis for further investigations.

One major challenge is that biological samples used to generate and validate the signature are often from heterogeneous biological contexts-controlled or in vitro samples may be used to generate the signature, but patient samples may be used for validation. In addition, systematic technical biases from multiple genome-profiling platforms often mask true biological variation. Addressing such challenges will enable us to better elucidate disease mechanisms and provide improved guidance for personalized therapeutics.\n                Here, we present a pathway profiling toolkit, Adaptive Signature Selection and InteGratioN (ASSIGN), which enables robust and context-specific pathway analyses by efficiently capturing pathway activity in heterogeneous sets of samples and across profiling technologies. The ASSIGN framework is based on a flexible Bayesian factor analysis approach that allows for simultaneous profiling of multiple correlated pathways and for the adaptation of pathway signatures into specific disease. We demonstrate the robustness and versatility of ASSIGN in estimating pathway activity in simulated data, cell lines perturbed pathways and in primary tissues samples including The Cancer Genome Atlas breast carcinoma samples and liver samples exposed to genotoxic carcinogens.\n                Software for our approach is available for download at: http:\/\/www.bioconductor.org\/packages\/release\/bioc\/html\/ASSIGN.html and https:\/\/github.com\/wevanjohnson\/ASSIGN.\n                Â© The Author 2015.

Learning algorithms and the prediction models they generate are typically evaluated on the basis of cross-validation error estimates in a few exemplary datasets. However, in most applications, the ultimate goal of prediction modeling is to provide accurate predictions for independent samples obtained in different settings. Cross-validation within exemplary datasets may not adequately reflect performance in the broader application context.\n                We develop and implement a systematic approach to 'cross-study validation', to replace or supplement conventional cross-validation when evaluating high-dimensional prediction models in independent datasets. We illustrate it via simulations and in a collection of eight estrogen-receptor positive breast cancer microarray gene-expression datasets, where the objective is predicting distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS). We computed the C-index for all pairwise combinations of training and validation datasets. We evaluate several alternatives for summarizing the pairwise validation statistics, and compare these to conventional cross-validation.\n                Our data-driven simulations and our application to survival prediction with eight breast cancer microarray datasets, suggest that standard cross-validation produces inflated discrimination accuracy for all algorithms considered, when compared to cross-study validation. Furthermore, the ranking of learning algorithms differs, suggesting that algorithms performing best in cross-validation may be suboptimal when evaluated through independent validation.\n                The survHD: Survival in High Dimensions package (http:\/\/www.bitbucket.org\/lwaldron\/survhd) will be made available through Bioconductor.\n                Â© The Author 2014.

In the present report, we review some indices often used as measures for viral quasispecies complexity and provide means for statistical inference , applying procedures taken from the ecology field.

quantification of proteins from biological samples. As with any high-throughput technology, systematic biases are often observed in LC-MS data, making normalization an important preprocessing step. Normalization models need to be flexible enough to capture biases of arbitrary complexity, while avoiding overfitting that would invalidate downstream statistical inference. Careful normalization of MS peak intensities would enable greater accuracy and precision in quantitative comparisons of protein abundance levels.\n        Results: We propose an algorithm, called EigenMS, that uses singular value decomposition to capture and remove biases from LC-MS peak intensity measurements. EigenMS is an adaptation of the surrogate variable analysis (SVA) algorithm of Leek and Storey, with the adaptations including (i) the handling of the widespread missing measurements that are typical in LC-MS, and (ii) a novel approach to preventing overfitting that facilitates the incorporation of EigenMS into an existing proteomics analysis pipeline. EigenMS is demonstrated using both large-scale calibration measurements and simulations to perform well relative to existing alternatives.\n        Availability: The software has been made available in the open source proteomics platform DAnTE (Polpitiya et al., 2008)) (http:\/\/omics.pnl.gov\/software\/), as well as in standalone software available at SourceForge (http:\/\/sourceforge.net).\n        Contact: yuliya@stat.tamu.edu\n        Supplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.","source":"PMC Extraction","linkDescriptions":null,"linkUrls":["http:\/\/mnmccall.com\/software","http:\/\/sourceforge.net","http:\/\/omics.pnl.gov\/software"],"publicationReferences":[20],"dateCreated":Thu Jul 06 10:49:47 PDT 2017,"suggestTag":["Gene Expression"],"suggestTagPrefix":["Gene Expression"],"id":11486,"publicationDate":["2014-08-06T00:00:00Z"],"funding":["NIH: CA009363","HHS: CA009363","NCI: CA009363","NIH: T32 CA009363","HHS: T32 CA009363","NCI: T32 CA009363","NIH: HG006853","NHGRI: HG006853","HHS: HG006853","NIH: CA138249","HHS: CA138249","NCI: CA138249","NIH: R01 CA138249","HHS: R01 CA138249","NCI: R01 CA138249","NIH: K99 HG006853","NHGRI: K99 HG006853","HHS: K99 HG006853","NIH: R25 CA090301","HHS: R25 CA090301","NCI: R25 CA090301","NIH: P41 RR018522","NCRR: P41 RR018522","HHS: P41 RR018522","NIH: R25-CA-90301","HHS: R25-CA-90301","NCI: R25-CA-90301","NIH: RR 18522","NCRR: RR 18522","HHS: RR 18522","NIH: Y1-AI-4894-01","NIAID: Y1-AI-4894-01","HHS: Y1-AI-4894-01"],"suggestName":"software","publicationPMID":[24764462],"domains":["Statistics and Probability","Computational Theory and Mathematics","Biochemistry","Molecular Biology","Computational Mathematics","Computer Science Applications"],"publicationTitle":["On non-detects in qPCR data."],"publicationDOI":["10.1093\/bioinformatics\/btu239","10.1093\/bioinformatics\/btp426"],"dateUpdated":Thu Jul 06 10:49:47 PDT 2017,"tags":["Algorithms","Animals","Gene Expression Profiling","Mice","Models, Theoretical","Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction","Software","Gene Expression"],"publicationJournal":["Bioinformatics"],"institutions":["University of Rochester Medical Center","Pacific Northwest National Laboratory"],"_version_":1572223336735309824,"name":"software","suggestNamePrefix":"software","authorEmails":null,"authors":["Matthew N MN McCall","Helene R HR McMurray","Hartmut H Land","Anthony A Almudevar","Yuliya V YV Karpievitch","Thomas T Taverner","Joshua N JN Adkins","Stephen J SJ Callister","Gordon A GA Anderson","Richard D RD Smith","Alan R AR Dabney"]},{"repoDescription":"This package provides a framework for the quantification and analysis of Short Reads.

Many current tool chains are based on the widely used file formats BAM and VCF or VCF-derivatives. However, for some desirable analyses, data management with these formats creates substantial implementation overhead, and much time is spent parsing files and collating data. We observe that a tally data structure, i.e. the table of counts of nucleotides × samples × strands × genomic positions, provides a reasonable intermediate level of abstraction for many genomics analyses, including single nucleotide variant (SNV) and InDel calling, copy-number estimation and mutation spectrum analysis. Here we present h5vc, a data structure and associated software for managing tallies. The software contains functionality for creating tallies from BAM files, flexible and scalable data visualization, data quality assessment, computing statistics relevant to variant calling and other applications. Through the simplicity of its API, we envision making low-level analysis of large sets of genome sequencing data accessible to a wider range of researchers.\n        Availability and implementation: The package h5vc for the statistical environment R is available through the Bioconductor project.

TSPs have two main advantages over many standard classifiers used in gene expression studies: (i) a TSP is based on only two genes, which leads to easily interpretable and inexpensive diagnostic tests and (ii) TSP classifiers are based on gene rankings, so they are more robust to variation in technical factors or normalization than classifiers based on expression levels of individual genes. Here I describe the R package, tspair, which can be used to quickly identify and assess TSP classifiers for gene expression data.\n        Availability: The R package tspair is freely available from Bioconductor: http:\/\/www.bioconductor.org\n        Contact: jtleek@jhu.edu","language":["R"],"source":"PMC Extraction","repoUpdatedDate":Sat May 07 09:43:49 PDT 2016,"repoHomepage":"","platforms":["Linux (Unix)","Windows 32","Windows 64","Mac OS X 10.6","Mac OS X 10.9"],"linkDescriptions":null,"linkUrls":["http:\/\/www.bioconductor.org","http:\/\/bioconductor.org\/packages\/release\/bioc\/html\/tspair.html","http:\/\/bioconductor.org\/packages\/release\/bioc\/vignettes\/tspair\/inst\/doc\/tsp.pdf","http:\/\/bioconductor.org\/packages\/release\/bioc\/src\/contrib\/tspair_1.26.0.tar.gz"],"publicationReferences":[8],"dateCreated":Thu Jul 06 10:43:27 PDT 2017,"repoCreationDate":Fri Mar 27 12:10:15 PDT 2015,"suggestTag":["Gene Expression"],"suggestTagPrefix":["Gene Expression"],"id":11499,"repoDownloads":118,"publicationDate":["2009-03-10T00:00:00Z"],"repoForks":0,"codeRepoURL":"http:\/\/bioconductor.org\/packages\/release\/bioc\/html\/tspair.html","funding":["NIH: UL1 RR025005","NCRR: UL1 RR025005","HHS: UL1 RR025005","NIH: 1UL1RR025005-01","NCRR: 1UL1RR025005-01","HHS: 1UL1RR025005-01"],"types":["Tool"],"repoOwner":"Bioconductor-mirror","repoName":"tspair","suggestName":"tspair","publicationPMID":[19276151],"domains":["Statistics and Probability","Computational Theory and Mathematics","Biochemistry","Molecular Biology","Computational Mathematics","Computer Science Applications","Genomics"],"publicationTitle":["The tspair package for finding top scoring pair classifiers in R."],"publicationDOI":["10.1093\/bioinformatics\/btp126"],"dateUpdated":Fri Jul 07 02:15:29 PDT 2017,"tags":["Gene Expression","Microarray"],"institutions":["Johns Hopkins School of Medicine"],"publicationJournal":["Bioinformatics"],"license":"GPL-2","_version_":1572223081856892928,"name":"tspair","suggestNamePrefix":"tspair","authorEmails":null,"authors":["Jeffrey T JT Leek","Jeffrey T.

All of the original Cellerator arrows, which represent reactions ranging from mass action, Michalesâ\u0080\u0093Mentenâ\u0080\u0093Henri (MMH) and Gene-Regulation (GRN) to Monodâ\u0080\u0093Wymanâ\u0080\u0093Changeaux (MWC), user defined reactions and enzymatic expansions (KMech), were previously represented with the Mathematica extended character set. These are now typed as reaction-like commands in ASCII text files that are read by Pycellerator, which includes a Python command line interface (CLI), a Python application programming interface (API) and an iPython notebook interface. Results: Cellerator reaction arrows are now input in text files. The arrows are parsed by Pycellerator and translated into differential equations in Python, and Python code is automatically generated to solve the system. Time courses are produced by executing the auto-generated Python code. Users have full freedom to modify the solver and utilize the complete set of standard Python tools. The new libraries are completely independent of the old Cellerator software and do not require Mathematica.

Results: We have added new Ruby classes for the MPileup and Variant Call Format (VCF) data formats emitted by SAMtools and introduced more analysis methods for variant analysis, including alternative allele calculation and allele frequency calling for SNPs. Our new implementation of bio-samtools also ensures that all the functionality of the SAMtools library is now supported and that bio-samtools can be easily extended to include future changes in SAMtools. bio-samtools 2 also provides methods that allow the user to directly produce visualization of alignment data.","source":"Grobid Extraction: Bioinformatics","publicationDOI":["10.1093\/bioinformatics\/btv178"],"tags":["genome analysis","genomics","samtools","alignments","including","bioinformatics"],"dateUpdated":Tue Jul 11 06:46:25 PDT 2017,"linkDescriptions":null,"linkUrls":["http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/List_of_sequence_alignment_software","https:\/\/rubygems.org\/gems\/ffi)package","https:\/\/github.com\/helios\/bioruby-samtools","http:\/\/www.biogems.info","http:\/\/bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org","http:\/\/picard.sourceforge.net","http:\/\/bioconductor.org\/packages\/release\/bioc\/html\/Rsamtools.htm.Ramirez-Gonzalez,R","https:\/\/github.com\/pysam-developers\/pysam).Here"],"institutions":["The Sainsbury Laboratory","The Genome Analysis Centre Norwich Research Park"],"dateCreated":Sun Mar 29 17:12:02 PDT 2015,"suggestTag":["genome analysis","genomics","samtools","alignments","including","bioinformatics"],"suggestTagPrefix":["genome analysis","genomics","samtools","alignments","including","bioinformatics"],"_version_":1572660561418649600,"name":"bioruby-samtools","suggestNamePrefix":"bioruby-samtools","id":11525,"authorEmails":null,"authors":["Graham J Etherington","Ricardo H Ramirez-Gonzalez","Dan Maclean"],"mergedID":10958},{"fundingAgencies":["NIH","NCRR","HHS"],"repoDescription":"Provides a platform for Operational Taxonomic Unit based analysis","repo":"bioconductor","description":"Summary: OTUbase is an R package designed to facilitate the analysis of operational taxonomic unit (OTU) data and sequence classification (taxonomic) data.

Approaches have been devised to quantify, for example, the tendency of a set of genes to be mutated in a 'mutually exclusive' manner. The significance of the proposed metrics is usually evaluated by computing P-values under appropriate null models. To this end, a Monte Carlo method (the switching-algorithm) is used to sample simulated datasets under a null model that preserves patient- and gene-wise mutation rates. In this method, a genomic dataset is represented as a bipartite network, to which Markov chain updates (switching-steps) are applied. These steps modify the network topology, and a minimal number of them must be executed to draw simulated datasets independently under the null model. This number has previously been deducted empirically to be a linear function of the total number of variants, making this process computationally expensive.\n                We present a novel approximate lower bound for the number of switching-steps, derived analytically. Additionally, we have developed the R package BiRewire, including new efficient implementations of the switching-algorithm. We illustrate the performances of BiRewire by applying it to large real cancer genomics datasets. We report vast reductions in time requirement, with respect to existing implementations\/bounds and equivalent P-value computations. Thus, we propose BiRewire to study statistical properties in genomic datasets, and other data that can be modeled as bipartite networks.\n                BiRewire is available on BioConductor at http:\/\/www.bioconductor.org\/packages\/2.13\/bioc\/html\/BiRewire.html.\n                Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.\n                Â© The Author 2014.

First, we describe an algorithm that identifies linear pathways. We then present a new algorithm for finding branched metabolic pathways.

Most of them are very efficient for short reads but inefficient or not applicable for reads >200 bp because the algorithms are heavily and specifically tuned for short queries with low sequencing error rate. However, some sequencing platforms already produce longer reads and others are expected to become available soon. For longer reads, hashing-based software such as BLAT and SSAHA2 remain the only choices. Nonetheless, these methods are substantially slower than short-read aligners in terms of aligned bases per unit time.\n        Results: We designed and implemented a new algorithm, Burrows-Wheeler Aligner's Smith-Waterman Alignment (BWA-SW), to align long sequences up to 1 Mb against a large sequence database (e.g. the human genome) with a few gigabytes of memory.

We also present htseq-count, a tool developed with HTSeq that preprocesses RNA-Seq data for differential expression analysis by counting the overlap of reads with genes.","language":["Java"],"source":"Grobid Extraction: Bioinformatics","platforms":["Web UI","Linux, Unix"],"linkDescriptions":null,"linkUrls":["https:\/\/toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu\/repository?repository_id=0d0c347d077f89b8","http:\/\/www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk\/projects\/fastqc","http:\/\/code.google.com\/p\/pysam\/)and","http:\/\/bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org","http:\/\/picard.sourceforge.net","http:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licenses\/by\/4.0","https:\/\/pypi.python.org\/pypi\/HTSeq.Contact","http:\/\/www-huber.embl.de\/HTSeq","https:\/\/toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu\/repository?repository_id=c45d6c51a4fcfc6c"],"dateCreated":Fri Sep 26 20:04:09 PDT 2014,"suggestTag":["genomics","bioinformatical","python","classes","htseq","reading","data"],"suggestTagPrefix":["genomics","bioinformatical","python","classes","htseq","reading","data"],"id":11538,"mergedID":10959,"types":["Tool"],"suggestName":"picard","domains":["Genomics","Biomedical","Metagenomics"],"publicationDOI":["10.1093\/bioinformatics\/btu638"],"dateUpdated":Fri Jul 07 02:11:16 PDT 2017,"tags":["Variant Analysis","Sequence Analysis","SAM","genomics","bioinformatical","python","classes","htseq","reading","data"],"institutions":["Genome Biology Unit, European Molecular Biology Laboratory"],"_version_":1572660563148800000,"name":"picard","suggestNamePrefix":"picard","authorEmails":null,"authors":["avowinkel","Simon Anders","Paul Theodor Pyl","Wolfgang Huber","devteam"]},{"types":["Tool"],"suggestName":"Genes by Predicted Signal Peptide","domains":["Proteomics"],"description":"Predicted Signal Peptide is a web service which allows users to search genes based on organism and other criteria such as minimum signalp sum score, minimum signalp D score and minimum signalp probability.","source":"BioCatalogue","platforms":["REST","REST API"],"tags":["Protein Sequence Analysis","Protein Composition","Sequence analysis","Sequence composition, complexity and repeats"],"dateUpdated":Mon Nov 09 21:01:59 PST 2015,"linkDescriptions":null,"linkUrls":["http:\/\/mango.ctegd.uga.edu\/jkissingLab\/SWS\/ToxodbAnnotatedWebservices\/SearchForGenes\/Proteinfeatures\/predictedsignalpeptide\/GenesWithSignalPeptide.wadl","https:\/\/www.biocatalogue.org\/services\/3402","Annotated version of the web service description document can be found at: http:\/\/mango.ctegd.uga.edu\/jkissingLab\/SWS\/ToxodbAnnotatedWebservices\/SearchForGenes\/Proteinfeatures\/predictedsignalpeptide\/GenesWithSignalPeptide.sawadl ","http:\/\/mango.ctegd.uga.edu\/jkissingLab\/SWS\/ToxodbAnnotatedWebservices\/SearchForGenes\/Proteinfeatures\/predictedsignalpeptide\/GenesWithSignalPeptide.sawadl"],"dateCreated":Mon Nov 09 21:01:59 PST 2015,"suggestTag":["Protein Sequence Analysis","Protein Composition"],"suggestTagPrefix":["Protein Sequence Analysis","Protein Composition"],"_version_":1572282547251970048,"name":"Genes by Predicted Signal Peptide","suggestNamePrefix":"Genes by Predicted Signal Peptide","id":11539},{"types":["Tool"],"suggestName":"BridgeRest","description":"Identifier mapping service for genes and proteins from multiple species, and for metabolites.

Gene set tests are valuable for increasing statistical power, organizing and interpreting results and for relating expression patterns across different experiments. Existing methods are based on permutation. Methods that rely on permutation of probes unrealistically assume independence of genes, while those that rely on permutation of sample are suitable only for two-group comparisons with a good number of replicates in each group.\n        Results: We present ROAST, a statistically rigorous gene set test that allows for gene-wise correlation while being applicable to almost any experimental design. Instead of permutation, ROAST uses rotation, a Monte Carlo technology for multivariate regression. Since the number of rotations does not depend on sample size, ROAST gives useful results even for experiments with minimal replication. ROAST allows for any experimental design that can be expressed as a linear model, and can also incorporate array weights and correlated samples. ROAST can be tuned for situations in which only a subset of the genes in the set are actively involved in the molecular pathway. ROAST can test for uni- or bi-direction regulation. Probes can also be weighted to allow for prior importance. The power and size of the ROAST procedure is demonstrated in a simulation study, and compared to that of a representative permutation method. Finally, ROAST is used to test the degree of transcriptional conservation between human and mouse mammary stems.\n        Availability: ROAST is implemented as a function in the Bioconductor package limma available from www.bioconductor.org\n        Contact: smyth@wehi.edu.au\n        Supplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.","language":["R"],"source":"PMC Extraction","repoUpdatedDate":Sun Jun 11 23:04:48 PDT 2017,"repoHomepage":"","platforms":["Linux (Unix)","Windows 32","Windows 64","Mac OS X 10.6","Mac OS X 10.9"],"linkDescriptions":null,"linkUrls":["http:\/\/bioconductor.org\/packages\/release\/bioc\/vignettes\/limma\/inst\/doc\/usersguide.pdf","http:\/\/bioconductor.org\/packages\/release\/bioc\/src\/contrib\/limma_3.24.15.tar.gz","http:\/\/bioconductor.org\/packages\/release\/bioc\/html\/limma.html","http:\/\/bioconductor.org\/packages\/release\/bioc\/vignettes\/limma\/inst\/doc\/intro.pdf,"],"publicationReferences":[30],"dateCreated":Thu Jul 06 10:44:56 PDT 2017,"repoCreationDate":Fri Mar 27 09:47:36 PDT 2015,"suggestTag":["Systems Biology"],"suggestTagPrefix":["Systems Biology"],"id":11548,"repoDownloads":12703,"publicationDate":["2010-07-07T00:00:00Z"],"repoForks":9,"codeRepoURL":"http:\/\/bioconductor.org\/packages\/release\/bioc\/html\/limma.html","types":["Tool"],"repoOwner":"Bioconductor-mirror","repoName":"limma","suggestName":"limma","publicationPMID":[20610611],"domains":["Statistics and Probability","Computational Theory and Mathematics","Biochemistry","Molecular Biology","Computational Mathematics","Computer Science Applications","Genomics"],"publicationTitle":["ROAST: rotation gene set tests for complex microarray experiments."],"publicationDOI":["10.1093\/bioinformatics\/btq401"],"dateUpdated":Fri Jul 07 02:12:46 PDT 2017,"tags":["Systems Biology","ExonArray","GeneExpression","Transcription","AlternativeSplicing","DifferentialExpression","DifferentialSplicing","GeneSetEnrichment","DataImport","Genetics","Bayesian","Clustering","Regression","TimeCourse","Microarray","microRNAArray","mRNAMicroarray","OneChannel","ProprietaryPlatforms","TwoChannel","RNASeq","BatchEffect","MultipleComparison","Normalization","Preprocessing","QualityControl"],"institutions":["University of Melbourne"],"publicationJournal":["Bioinformatics"],"license":"GPL (>=2)","_version_":1572223159208247296,"name":"limma","suggestNamePrefix":"limma","authorEmails":null,"authors":["Di D Wu","Elgene E Lim","FranÃ§ois F Vaillant","Marie-Liesse ML Asselin-Labat","Jane E JE Visvader","Gordon K GK Smyth","Gordon Smyth [cre","Matthew Ritchie [ctb]","Jeremy Silver [ctb]","James Wettenhall [ctb]","Natalie Thorne [ctb]","Davis McCarthy [ctb]","Di Wu [ctb]","Yifang Hu [ctb]","Wei Shi [ctb]","Belinda Phipson [ctb]","Alicia Oshlack [ctb]","Carolyn de Graaf [ctb]","Mette Langaas [ctb]","Egil Ferkingstad [ctb]","Marcus Davy [ctb]","Francois Pepin [ctb]","Dongseok Choi [ctb]","Aaron Lun [ctb]"]},{"fundingAgencies":["NIH","NIAID","NCRR","HHS","PHS"],"repoDescription":"This package implements a model of per-position sequencing bias in high-throughput sequencing data using a simple Bayesian network, the structure and parameters of which are trained on a set of aligned reads and a reference genome sequence.","repo":"bioconductor","description":"Motivation: Quantification of sequence abundance in RNA-Seq experiments is often conflated by protocol-specific sequence bias. The exact sources of the bias are unknown, but may be influenced by polymerase chain reaction amplification, or differing primer affinities and mixtures, for example. The result is decreased accuracy in many applications, such as de novo gene annotation and transcript quantification.\n        Results: We present a new method to measure and correct for these influences using a simple graphical model. Our model does not rely on existing gene annotations, and model selection is performed automatically making it applicable with few assumptions. We evaluate our method on several datasets, and by multiple criteria, demonstrating that it effectively decreases bias and increases uniformity.

Algorithms used for this purpose include fragment-based fingerprint and graph-based maximum common substructure (MCS) methods. MCS approaches provide one of the most accurate similarity measures. However, their rigid matching policies limit them to the identification of perfect MCSs. To eliminate this restriction, we introduce a new mismatch tolerant search method for identifying flexible MCSs (FMCSs) containing a user-defin-able number of atom and\/or bond mismatches. Results: The fmcsR package provides an R interface, with the time-consuming steps of the FMCS algorithm implemented in CÃ¾Ã¾. It includes utilities for pairwise compound comparisons, structure similarity searching, clustering and visualization of MCSs. In comparison with an existing MCS tool, fmcsR shows better time performance over a wide range of compound sizes. When mismatching of atoms or bonds is turned on, the compute times increase as expected, and the resulting FMCSs are often substantially larger than their strict MCS counterparts. Based on extensive virtual screening (VS) tests, the flexible matching feature enhances the enrichment of active structures at the top of MCS-based similarity search results. With respect to overall and early enrichment performance, FMCS outperforms most of the seven other VS methods considered in these tests.

Different modern analytical biochemistry and proteomics methods depend on the isoelectric point as a principal feature for protein and peptide characterization. Protein separation by isoelectric point is a critical part of 2-D gel electrophoresis, a key precursor of proteomics, where discrete spots can be digested in-gel, and proteins subsequently identified by analytical mass spectrometry. Peptide fractionation according to their pI is also widely used in current proteomics sample preparation procedures previous to the LC-MS\/MS analysis. Therefore accurate theoretical prediction of pI would expedite such analysis. While such pI calculation is widely used, it remains largely untested, motivating our efforts to benchmark pI prediction methods. Results: Using data from the database PIP-DB and one publically available dataset as our reference gold standard, we have undertaken the benchmarking of pI calculation methods. We find that methods vary in their accuracy and are highly sensitive to the choice of basis set. The machine-learning algorithms, especially the SVM-based algorithm, showed a superior performance when studying peptide mixtures. In general, learning-based pI prediction methods (such as Cofactor, SVM and Branca) require a large training dataset and their resulting performance will strongly depend of the quality of that data. In contrast with Iterative methods, machine-learning algorithms have the advantage of being able to add new features to improve the accuracy of prediction.","source":"Migration","linkDescriptions":null,"linkUrls":["https:\/\/github.com\/nodejs\/node-v0.x-archive","http:\/\/github.com","http:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licenses\/by\/4.0","https:\/\/github.com","https:\/\/github.com\/ypri"],"emails":["birte.kehr@decode.is","journals.permissions@oup.com"],"publicationReferences":[39],"dateCreated":Sat Nov 14 17:38:21 PST 2015,"suggestTag":["algorithms","values","peptides","proteins","methods"],"suggestTagPrefix":["algorithms","values","peptides","proteins","methods"],"id":11561,"publicationDate":["2016-05-07T00:00:00Z"],"funding":["BBSRC: BB\/K01997X\/1"],"suggestName":"github.com","publicationPMID":[25926346],"domains":["Statistics and Probability","Computational Theory and Mathematics","Biochemistry","Molecular Biology","Computational Mathematics","Computer Science Applications"],"publicationDOI":["10.1093\/bioinformatics\/btv273","10.1093\/bioinformatics\/btv674"],"publicationTitle":["PopIns: population-scale detection of novel sequence insertions."],"tags":["sequence insertions","genomics","assembling","reads","individuals","insertion","sequencing","algorithms","values","peptides","proteins","methods"],"dateUpdated":Sun Apr 23 20:07:11 PDT 2017,"institutions":["deCODE genetics\/Amgen","Institute of Biomedical and Neural Engineering ReykjavÃ­k University","Faculty of Industrial Engineering Mechanical Engineering and Computer Science University of Iceland","School of Life and Health Sciences Aston University","Department European Molecular Biology Laboratory European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI) Wellcome Trust Genome Campus","Department of Proteomics Center of Molecular Immunology","Department of Proteomics Center for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology Ciudad de la Habana"],"publicationJournal":["Bioinformatics"],"_version_":1572285651760447488,"name":"github.com","suggestNamePrefix":"github.com","authorEmails":null,"authors":["Birte Kehr","PÃ¡ Ll Melsted","Bjarni V HalldÃ³ Rsson","Enrique Audain","Yassel Ramos","Henning Hermjakob","Darren R Flower","Yasset Perez-Riverol"]},{"fundingAgencies":["NIH","UCSC"],"repo":"github","description":"Reading frame altering genomic variants can impact gene expression levels and the structure of protein products, thus potentially inducing disease phenotypes. Current annotation approaches report the impact of such variants in the context of altered DNA sequence only; attributes of the resulting transcript, reading frame and translated protein product are not reported. To remedy this shortcoming, we present a new genetic annotation approach termed Codon Consequence Scanner (COCOS). Implemented as an Ensembl variant effect predictor (VEP) plugin, COCOS captures amino acid sequence alterations stemming from variants that produce an altered reading frame, such as stop-lost variants and small insertions and deletions (InDels).

Although a large number of algorithms for computing a multiple sequence alignment have been designed, the efficient computation of highly accurate multiple alignments is still a challenge. Results: We present MSAProbs, a new and practical multiple alignment algorithm for protein sequences. The design of MSAProbs is based on a combination of pair hidden Markov models and partition functions to calculate posterior probabilities. Furthermore, two critical bioinformatics techniques, namely weighted probabilistic consistency transformation and weighted profileâ\u0080\u0093profile alignment, are incorporated to improve alignment accuracy. Assessed using the popular benchmarks: BAliBASE, PREFAB, SABmark and OXBENCH, MSAProbs achieves statistically significant accuracy improvements over the existing top performing aligners, including ClustalW, MAFFT, MUSCLE, ProbCons and Probalign. Furthermore, MSAProbs is optimized for multi-core CPUs by employing a multi-threaded design, leading to a competitive execution time compared to other aligners.

interpretation. We present a formal approach for microarray quality assessment that is based on dimension reduction of established measures of signal and noise components of expression followed by parametric multivariate outlier testing.\n        Results: We applied our approach to several data resources. First, as a negative control, we found that the Affymetrix and Illumina contributions to MAQC data were free from outliers at a nominal outlier flagging rate of α=0.01. Second, we created a tunable framework for artificially corrupting intensity data from the Affymetrix Latin Square spike-in experiment to allow investigation of sensitivity and specificity of quality assurance (QA) criteria. Third, we applied the procedure to 507 Affymetrix microarray GeneChips processed with RNA from human peripheral blood samples. We show that exclusion of arrays by this approach substantially increases inferential power, or the ability to detect differential expression, in large clinical studies.\n        Availability: http:\/\/bioconductor.org\/packages\/2.3\/bioc\/html\/arrayMvout.html and http:\/\/bioconductor.org\/packages\/2.3\/bioc\/html\/affyContam.html affyContam (credentials: readonly\/readonly)\n        Contact: aasare@immunetolerance.org; stvjc@channing.harvard.edu","language":["R"],"source":"PMC Extraction","repoUpdatedDate":Thu May 05 15:05:21 PDT 2016,"repoHomepage":"","platforms":["Linux (Unix)","Windows 32","Windows 64","Mac OS X 10.6","Mac OS X 10.9"],"linkDescriptions":null,"linkUrls":["http:\/\/bioconductor.org\/packages\/2.3\/bioc\/html\/affyContam.html","http:\/\/bioconductor.org\/packages\/2.3\/bioc\/html\/arrayMvout.html","http:\/\/bioconductor.org\/packages\/release\/bioc\/vignettes\/arrayMvout\/inst\/doc\/arrayMvout.pdf","http:\/\/bioconductor.org\/packages\/release\/bioc\/html\/arrayMvout.html","http:\/\/bioconductor.org\/packages\/release\/bioc\/src\/contrib\/arrayMvout_1.26.0.tar.gz"],"publicationReferences":[12],"dateCreated":Thu Jul 06 10:43:00 PDT 2017,"repoCreationDate":Fri Mar 27 07:34:12 PDT 2015,"suggestTag":["Gene Expression"],"suggestTagPrefix":["Gene Expression"],"id":11570,"repoDownloads":117,"publicationDate":["2008-11-16T00:00:00Z"],"repoForks":0,"codeRepoURL":"http:\/\/bioconductor.org\/packages\/release\/bioc\/html\/arrayMvout.html","funding":["NIH: P41 HG004059-01","NHGRI: P41 HG004059-01","HHS: P41 HG004059-01"],"types":["Tool"],"repoOwner":"Bioconductor-mirror","repoName":"arrayMvout","suggestName":"arrayMvout","publicationPMID":[19015138],"domains":["Statistics and Probability","Computational Theory and Mathematics","Biochemistry","Molecular Biology","Computational Mathematics","Computer Science Applications","Genomics"],"publicationTitle":["Power enhancement via multivariate outlier testing with gene expression arrays."],"publicationDOI":["10.1093\/bioinformatics\/btn591"],"dateUpdated":Fri Jul 07 02:10:53 PDT 2017,"tags":["Gene Expression","Infrastructure","Microarray","QualityControl"],"institutions":["Harvard Medical School","University of California, San Francisco"],"publicationJournal":["Bioinformatics"],"license":"Artistic-2.0","_version_":1572223066120912896,"name":"arrayMvout","suggestNamePrefix":"arrayMvout","authorEmails":null,"authors":["Adam L AL Asare","Zhong Z Gao","Vincent J VJ Carey","Richard R Wang","Vicki V Seyfert-Margolis","Z.

Modulating the interaction between proteins by means of small (chemical) agents is therefore a promising route for future novel therapeutic interventions. In this context, peptides are gaining momentum as emerging agents for the modulation of PPIs. Results: We reported a novel computational, structure and knowledge-based approach to model orthosteric peptides to target PPIs: PiPreD. PiPreD relies on a precompiled and bespoken library of structural motifs, iMotifs, extracted from protein complexes and a fast structural modeling algorithm driven by the location of native chemical groups on the interface of the protein target named anchor residues. PiPreD comprehensive and systematically samples the entire interface deriving peptide conformations best suited for the given region on the protein interface. PiPreD complements the existing technologies and provides new solutions for the disruption of selected interactions.

The method approximates clustering based on the root mean square deviation by first mapping structures to Gauss integral vectorsâ\u0080\u0094which were introduced by RÃ¸gen and co-workersâ\u0080\u0094and subsequently performing K-means clustering. Conclusions: Compared to current methods, Pleiades dramatically improves on the time needed to perform clustering, and can cluster a significantly larger number of structures, while providing state-of-the-art results.

Detection of CaM binding proteins and their interaction sites experimentally requires a significant effort, so accurate methods for their prediction are important. Results: We present a novel algorithm (MI-1 SVM) for binding site prediction and evaluate its performance on a set of CaM-binding proteins extracted from the Calmodulin Target Database. Our approach directly models the problem of binding site prediction as a large-margin classification problem, and is able to take into account uncertainty in binding site location. We show that the proposed algorithm performs better than the standard SVM formulation, and illustrate its ability to recover known CaM binding motifs. A highly accurate cascaded classification approach using the proposed binding site prediction method to predict CaM binding proteins in Arabidopsis thaliana is also presented. Availability: Matlab code for training MI-1 SVM and the cascaded classification approach is available on request.

Experimental techniques that study such motifs use short peptides to mimic the structural properties of interacting proteins. Continued development of these methods allows for large-scale screening, resulting in vast amounts of peptide sequences, potentially containing information on multiple protein-protein interactions. Processing of such datasets is a complex but essential task for large-scale studies investigating protein-protein interactions.\n        Results: The software tool presented in this article is able to rapidly identify multiple clusters of sequences carrying shared specificity motifs in massive datasets from various sources and generate multiple sequence alignments of identified clusters. The method was applied on a previously published smaller dataset containing distinct classes of ligands for SH3 domains, as well as on a new, an order of magnitude larger dataset containing epitopes for several monoclonal antibodies. The software successfully identified clusters of sequences mimicking epitopes of antibody targets, as well as secondary clusters revealing that the antibodies accept some deviations from original epitope sequences. Another test indicates that processing of even much larger datasets is computationally feasible.\n        Availability and implementation: Hammock is published under GNU GPL v. 3 license and is freely available as a standalone program (from http:\/\/www.recamo.cz\/en\/software\/hammock-cluster-peptides\/) or as a tool for the Galaxy toolbox (from https:\/\/toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu\/view\/hammock\/hammock).

It captures realistic non-Gaussian data distributions with heavy tails as observed in gene expression measurements.

It is emerging as a standard tool for extracting knowledge from gene expression measurements.

FABIA is based on a multiplicative model, which accounts for linear dependencies between gene expression and conditions, and also captures heavy-tailed distributions as observed in real-world transcriptomic data. The generative framework allows to utilize well-founded model selection methods and to apply Bayesian techniques.\n        Results: On 100 simulated datasets with known true, artificially implanted biclusters, FABIA clearly outperformed all 11 competitors. On these datasets, FABIA was able to separate spurious biclusters from true biclusters by ranking biclusters according to their information content.

Hyper and hypomethylation of genes is an alternative mechanism to deregulate gene expression in a wide range of diseases. At the same time, high-throughput DNA methylation assays have been developed generating vast amounts of genome wide DNA methylation measurements. Yet, few tools exist that can formally identify hypo and hypermethylated genes that are predictive of transcription and thus functionally relevant for a particular disease. To accommodate this lack of tools, we developed MethylMix, an algorithm implemented in R to identify disease specific hyper and hypomethylated genes. MethylMix is based on a beta mixture model to identify methylation states and compares them with the normal DNA methylation state. MethylMix introduces a novel metric, the \u2018Differential Methylation value\u2019 or DM-value defined as the difference of a methylation state with the normal methylation state.

Regulatory SNPs (rSNPs) are such SNPs that affect gene regulation by changing transcription factor (TF) binding affinities to genomic sequences. Identifying potential rSNPs is crucial for understanding disease mechanisms. In silico methods that evaluate the impact of SNPs on TF binding affinities are not scalable for large-scale analysis.\n                We describe A: ffinity T: esting for regulatory SNP: s (atSNP), a computationally efficient R package for identifying rSNPs in silico. atSNP implements an importance sampling algorithm coupled with a first-order Markov model for the background nucleotide sequences to test the significance of affinity scores and SNP-driven changes in these scores. Application of atSNP with >20â\u0080\u0089K SNPs indicates that atSNP is the only available tool for such a large-scale task. atSNP provides user-friendly output in the form of both tables and composite logo plots for visualizing SNP-motif interactions.

Manta is optimized for rapid germline and somatic analysis, calling structural variants, medium-sized indels and large insertions on standard compute hardware in less than a tenth of the time that comparable methods require to identify only subsets of these variant types: for example NA12878 at 50Ã\u0082 genomic coverage is analyzed in less than 20 min. Manta can discover and score variants based on supporting paired and split-read evidence, with scoring models optimized for germline analysis of diploid individuals and somatic analysis of tumor-normal sample pairs. Call quality is similar to or better than comparable methods, as determined by pedigree consistency of germline calls and comparison of somatic calls to COSMIC database variants. Manta consistently assembles a higher fraction of its calls to base-pair resolution, allowing for improved downstream annotation and analysis of clinical significance.

Here, we develop an approach for predicting the reactivity of small-molecule metabolites in enzyme-catalyzed reactions that combines expert knowledge, computational chemistry and machine learning. Results: We classified 4843 reactions documented in the KEGG database, from all six Enzyme Commission classes (EC 1â\u0080\u00936), into 80 reaction classes, each of which is marked by a characteristic functional group transformation. Reaction centers and surrounding local structures in substrates and products of these reactions were represented using SMARTS. We found that each of the SMARTS-defined chemical substructures is widely distributed among metabolites, but only a fraction of the functional groups in these substructures are reactive. Using atomic properties of atoms in a putative reaction center and molecular properties as features, we trained support vector machine (SVM) classifiers to discriminate between functional groups that are reactive and non-reactive. Classifier accuracy was assessed by cross-validation analysis. A typical sensitivity [TP\/(TP + FN)] or specificity [TN\/(TN + FP)] is â\u0089\u0088 0.8. Our results suggest that metabolic reactivity of small-molecule compounds can be predicted with reasonable accuracy based on the presence of a potentially reactive functional group and the chemical features of its local environment.

On real data, we demonstrate that our method achieves comparable accuracy to alternative methods for estimating site allele count, for inferring allele frequency spectrum and for association mapping.

Given a list of GO terms, RamiGO uses the AmiGO visualize API to import Graphviz-DOT format files into R, and export these either as images (SVG, PNG) or into Cytoscape for extended network analyses. RamiGO provides easy customization of annotation, highlighting of specific GO terms, colouring of terms by P-value or export of a simplified summary GO tree. We illustrate RamiGO functionalities in a genome-wide gene set analysis of prognostic genes in breast cancer.\n        Availability and implementation: RamiGO is provided in R\/Bioconductor, is open source under the Artistic-2.0 License and is available with a user manual containing installation, operating instructions and tutorials. It requires R version 2.15.0 or higher.
