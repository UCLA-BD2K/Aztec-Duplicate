One approach to multiplexing is to use short DNA indices to uniquely identify each sample. After sequencing, reads must be assigned in silico to the sample of origin, a process referred to as demultiplexing. Demultiplexing software typically identifies the sample of origin using a fixed number of mismatches between the read index and a reference index set. This approach may fail or misassign reads when the sequencing quality of the indices is poor. Results: We introduce deML, a maximum likelihood algorithm that demultiplexes Illumina sequences. deML computes the likelihood of an observed index sequence being derived from a specified sample. A quality score which reflects the probability of the assignment being correct is generated for each read. Using these quality scores, even very problematic datasets can be demultiplexed and an error threshold can be set.

The former is computationally slow and has difficulty to identify clusters of irregular shapes. The latter approach cannot be applied directly to high-dimensional data as the computational time and memory become unmanageable and the estimated histogram is unreliable. An algorithm without these two problems would be very useful. Results: In this article, we combine ideas from the finite mixture model and histogram spatial exploration. This new algorithm, which we call flowPeaks, can be applied directly to high-dimensional data and identify irregular shape clusters. The algorithm first uses K-means algorithm with a large K to partition the cell population into many small clusters. These partitioned data allow the generation of a smoothed density function using the finite mixture model.

Detection of CaM binding proteins and their interaction sites experimentally requires a significant effort, so accurate methods for their prediction are important. Results: We present a novel algorithm (MI-1 SVM) for binding site prediction and evaluate its performance on a set of CaM-binding proteins extracted from the Calmodulin Target Database. Our approach directly models the problem of binding site prediction as a large-margin classification problem, and is able to take into account uncertainty in binding site location. We show that the proposed algorithm performs better than the standard SVM formulation, and illustrate its ability to recover known CaM binding motifs. A highly accurate cascaded classification approach using the proposed binding site prediction method to predict CaM binding proteins in Arabidopsis thaliana is also presented.

Advances of next generation sequencing technologies and availability of short read data enable the detection of structural variations (SVs). Deletions, an important type of SVs, have been suggested in association with genetic diseases. There are three types of deletions: blunt deletions , deletions with microhomologies and deletions with microsinsertions. The last two types are very common in the human genome, but they pose difficulty for the detection. Furthermore, finding deletions from sequencing data remains challenging. It is highly appealing to develop sensitive and accurate methods to detect deletions from sequencing data, especially deletions with microho-mology and deletions with microinsertion. Results: We present a novel method called Sprites (SPlit Read realIgnment To dEtect Structural variants) which finds deletions from sequencing data. It aligns a whole soft-clipping read rather than its clipped part to the target sequence, a segment of the reference which is determined by spanning reads, in order to find the longest prefix or suffix of the read that has a match in the target sequence. This alignment aims to solve the problem of deletions with microhomologies and deletions with microinsertions. Using both simulated and real data we show that Sprites performs better on detecting deletions compared with other current methods in terms of F-score. Availability and implementation: Sprites is open source software and freely available at https:\/\/ github.com\/zhangzhen\/sprites.

Most of the existing mapping programs do not model homopolymer errors when aligning reads against the reference. The resulting alignments will then contain various kinds of mismatches and indels that confound the accurate determination of variant loci and alleles. Results: To address these challenges, we realign reads against the reference using our previously proposed hidden Markov model that models homopolymer errors and then merges these pairwise alignments into a weighted alignment graph. Based on our weighted alignment graph and hidden Markov model, we develop a method called PyroHMMvar, which can simultaneously detect short indels and SNPs, as demonstrated in human resequencing data. Specifically, by applying our methods to simulated diploid datasets, we demonstrate that PyroHMMvar produces more accurate results than state-of-the-art methods, such as Samtools and GATK, and is less sensitive to mapping parameter settings than the other methods. We also apply PyroHMMvar to analyze one human whole genome resequencing dataset, and the results confirm that PyroHMMvar predicts SNPs and indels accurately.

A detailed understanding of the control of gene expression at the level of messenger RNA translation is vital to elucidating a systems-level view of complex molecular programs in the cell. Establishing the degree to which such post-transcriptional regulation can mediate specific phenotypes is similarly critical to elucidating the molecular pathogenesis of diseases such as cancer. Recently, methods for massively parallel sequencing of ribosome-bound fragments of messenger RNA have begun to uncover genome-wide translational control at codon resolution. Despite its promise for deeply characterizing mammalian proteomes, few analytical methods exist for the comprehensive analysis of this paired RNA and ribosome data. Results: We describe the Babel framework, an analytical methodology for assessing the significance of changes in translational regulation within cells and between conditions. This approach facilitates the analysis of translation genome-wide while allowing statistically principled gene-level inference. Babel is based on an errors-in-variables regression model that uses the negative binomial distribution and draws inference using a parametric bootstrap approach. We demonstrate the operating characteristics of Babel on simulated data and use its gene-level inference to extend prior analyses significantly, discovering new translationally regulated modules under mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway signaling control.

Our empirical analysis of the accuracy and convergence rate of our algorithm , CAncer PRogression Inference (CAPRI), shows that it outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms addressing similar problems. Motivation: Several cancer-related genomic data have become available (e.g. The Cancer Genome Atlas, TCGA) typically involving hundreds of patients. At present, most of these data are aggre-gated in a cross-sectional fashion providing all measurements at the time of diagnosis. Our goal is to infer cancer 'progression' models from such data. These models are represented as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) of collections of 'selectivity' relations, where a mutation in a gene A 'selects' for a later mutation in a gene B. Gaining insight into the structure of such progressions has the potential to improve both the stratification of patients and personalized therapy choices. Results: The CAPRI algorithm relies on a scoring method based on a probabilistic theory developed by Suppes, coupled with bootstrap and maximum likelihood inference. The resulting algorithm is efficient, achieves high accuracy and has good complexity, also, in terms of convergence properties. CAPRI performs especially well in the presence of noise in the data, and with limited sample sizes. Moreover CAPRI, in contrast to other approaches, robustly reconstructs different types of confluent trajectories despite irregularities in the data. We also report on an ongoing investigation using CAPRI to study atypical Chronic Myeloid Leukemia, in which we uncovered non trivial select-ivity relations and exclusivity patterns among key genomic events.

However, it is not yet clear how best to use this information to discover general rules or interaction patterns about structural protein\u2013protein interactions. Improving our ability to detect and exploit structural interaction patterns will help to provide a better 3D picture of the known protein interactome, and will help to guide docking-based predictions of the 3D structures of unsolved protein complexes. Results: This article presents KBDOCK, a 3D database approach for spatially clustering protein binding sites and for performing template-based (knowledge-based) protein docking. KBDOCK combines residue contact information from the 3DID database with the Pfam protein domain family classification together with coordinate data from the Protein Data Bank. This allows the 3D configurations of all known hetero domain\u2013domain interactions to be superposed and clustered for each Pfam family. We find that most Pfam domain families have up to four hetero binding sites, and over 60% of all domain families have just one hetero binding site. The utility of this approach for template-based docking is demonstrated using 73 complexes from the Protein Docking Benchmark. Overall, up to 45 out of 73 complexes may be modelled by direct homology to existing domain interfaces, and key binding site information is found for 24 of the 28 remaining complexes. These results show that KBDOCK can often provide useful information for predicting the structures of unknown protein complexes.","language":["JavaScript","Java"],"source":"Bioinformatics

Strand-specific reads allow for detection of antisense events and a higher resolution of expression profiles enabling extension of current transcript annotations. However, applications making use of this strandedness information are still scarce. Results: Here we present a tool (Janus), which focuses on the identification of transcriptional active regions in antisense orientation to known and novel transcribed elements of the genome. Janus can compare the antisense events of multiple samples and assigns scores to identify mutual expression of either transcript in a sense\/ antisense pair, which could hint to regulatory mechanisms. Janus is able to make use of single-nucleotide variant (SNV) and methylation data, if available, and reports the sense to antisense ratio of regions in the vicinity of the identified genetic and epigenetic variation. Janus interrogates positions of heterozygous SNVs to identify strand-specific allelic imbalance.

Sequence-variation analysis is conventionally performed on mapping results that are highly redundant and occasionally contain undesirable heuristic biases. A straightforward approach to single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis, using the Burrows\u2013Wheeler transform (BWT) of short-read data, is proposed. Results: The BWT makes it possible to simultaneously process collections of read fragments of the same sequences; accordingly, SNPs were found from the BWT much faster than from the mapping results. It took only a few minutes to find SNPs from the BWT (with a supplementary data, fragment depth of coverage [FDC]) using a desktop workstation in the case of human exome or transcrip-tome sequencing data and 20 min using a dual-CPU server in the case of human genome sequenc-ing data. The SNPs found with the proposed method almost agreed with those found by a time-consuming state-of-the-art tool, except for the cases in which the use of fragments of reads led to sensitivity loss or sequencing depth was not sufficient. These exceptions were predictable in advance on the basis of minimum length for uniqueness (MLU) and FDC defined on the reference genome. Moreover, BWT and FDC were computed in less time than it took to get the mapping results , provided that the data were large enough.

information on protein domains and their pair-wise interactions has been made available in public databases. However, it is not yet clear how best to use this information to discover general rules or interaction patterns about structural protein\u2013protein interactions. Improving our ability to detect and exploit structural interaction patterns will help to provide a better 3D picture of the known protein interactome, and will help to guide docking-based predictions of the 3D structures of unsolved protein complexes. Results: This article presents KBDOCK, a 3D database approach for spatially clustering protein binding sites and for performing template-based (knowledge-based) protein docking. KBDOCK combines residue contact information from the 3DID database with the Pfam protein domain family classification together with coordinate data from the Protein Data Bank. This allows the 3D configurations of all known hetero domain\u2013domain interactions to be superposed and clustered for each Pfam family. We find that most Pfam domain families have up to four hetero binding sites, and over 60% of all domain families have just one hetero binding site. The utility of this approach for template-based docking is demonstrated using 73 complexes from the Protein Docking Benchmark. Overall, up to 45 out of 73 complexes may be modelled by direct homology to existing domain interfaces, and key binding site information is found for 24 of the 28 remaining complexes. These results show that KBDOCK can often provide useful information for predicting the structures of unknown protein complexes.","language":["JavaScript","Java"],"source":"Bioinformatics

To allow further downstream analysis and to estimate performance, predicted fusion genes from different tools have to be compared. However, the transcriptomic context complicates genomic location-based matching. FusionMatcher (FuMa) is a program that reports identical fusion genes based on gene-name annotations.

implementing the Significance Analysis of Prognostic Signatures method (SAPS). SAPS provides a robust method for identifying biologically significant gene sets associated with patient survival. Three basic statistics are computed. First, patients are clustered into two survival groups based on differential expression of a candidate gene set. P_pure is calculated as the probability of no survival difference between the two groups. Next, the same procedure is applied to randomly generated gene sets, and P_random is calculated as the proportion achieving a P_pure as significant as the candidate gene set. Finally, a pre-ranked Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) is performed by ranking all genes by concordance index, and P_enrich is computed to indicate the degree to which the candidate gene set is enriched for genes with univariate prognostic significance. A SAPS_score is calculated to summarize the three statistics, and optionally a Q-value is computed to estimate the significance of the SAPS_score by calculating SAPS_scores for random gene sets.","language":["R"],"owners":["adminOnly"],"source":"BioConductor","inputFiles":["EMBL format","Sequence"],"licenseUrls":[""],"linkDescriptions":["homepage","documentation"],"platforms":["Linux (Unix)","Windows 32","Windows 64","Mac OS X 10.6","Mac OS X 10.9","Web UI"],"linkUrls":["http:\/\/bioconductor.org\/packages\/release\/bioc\/html\/saps.html","http:\/\/bioconductor.org\/packages\/release\/bioc\/vignettes\/saps\/inst\/doc\/","http:\/\/mobyle.pasteur.fr\/#forms::saps"],"dateCreated":[Mon Nov 09 21:01:46 PST 2015],"suggestTag":["BiomedicalInformatics","GeneExpression","GeneSetEnrichment","DifferentialExpression","Survival"],"suggestTagPrefix":["BiomedicalInformatics","GeneExpression","GeneSetEnrichment","DifferentialExpression","Survival"],"maintainerEmails":["<saps@schmolze.com>","place@holder.com"],"logo":"http:\/\/bioconductor.org\/images\/logo_bioconductor.gif","id":10785,"sourceCodeURL":["http:\/\/bioconductor.org\/packages\/release\/bioc\/src\/contrib\/saps_2.0.0.tar.gz"],"maintainers":["Daniel Schmolze ","Placeholder"],"types":["Tool","Tool (analysis)"],"suggestName":"saps","domains":["Genomics","Proteomics"],"dateUpdated":[Mon Nov 09 21:01:46 PST 2015],"tags":["BiomedicalInformatics","GeneExpression","GeneSetEnrichment","DifferentialExpression","Survival","Protein properties"],"dependencies":["R (>= 2.14.0)"," survival"],"licenses":["MIT + file LICENSE"],"_version_":1560022055055785984,"name":"saps","suggestNamePrefix":"saps","authorEmails":["","",""],"authors":["Daniel Schmolze [aut","Andrew Beck [aut]","Benjamin Haibe-Kains [aut]"]},{"description":"Creates a consensus from multiple alignments","language":["HTML"],"owners":["adminOnly"],"source":"BioCatalogue","linkDescriptions":["Homepage","Documentation","WSDL"],"platforms":["SOAP","SOAP WS"],"linkUrls":["https:\/\/www.biocatalogue.org\/services\/3641","http:\/\/genius.embnet.dkfz-heidelberg.de\/menu\/hobit\/embdoc\/cons.html","http:\/\/genius.embnet.dkfz-heidelberg.de\/menu\/hobit\/embapps\/wsdl\/cons.wsdl"],"dateCreated":[Mon Nov 09 21:01:59 PST 2015],"suggestTag":["Protein Sequence Analysis","Protein Multiple Alignment"],"suggestTagPrefix":["Protein Sequence Analysis","Protein Multiple Alignment"],"maintainerEmails":["",""],"logo":"https:\/\/www.biocatalogue.org\/assets\/logo_small-da549203f66b74dab67f592878053664.png","id":10786,"sourceCodeURL":["http:\/\/www.dkfz-heidelberg.de\/menu\/tomcat\/as\/alignment_consensus.cons.derived"],"maintainers":["http:\/\/www.dkfz.de\/en\/kontakt.php","Not Available"],"types":["Tool"],"suggestName":"consService","domains":["Proteomics"],"dateUpdated":[Mon Nov 09 21:01:59 PST 2015],"tags":["Protein Sequence Analysis","Protein Multiple Alignment","Sequence analysis","Sequence comparison"],"institutions":["German Cancer Research Center"],"_version_":1560022043478458368,"name":"consService","suggestNamePrefix":"consService"},{"outputFiles":["Data"],"versionNum":"1.1.0","description":"Displays the information available in the Open PHACTS Linked Data cache about a compound.","language":["JavaScript"],"owners":["adminOnly"],"source":"Biojs","inputFiles":["Data"],"linkDescriptions":["Homepage","Documentation","Bugs"],"platforms":["Web UI"],"linkUrls":["https:\/\/www.npmjs.com\/package\/openphacts-vis-compoundinfo","https:\/\/github.com\/openphacts\/openphacts-vis-compoundinfo","https:\/\/github.com\/openphacts\/openphacts-vis-compoundinfo\/issues"],"dateCreated":[Mon Nov 09 21:01:42 PST 2015],"suggestTag":["openphacts","compound"],"suggestTagPrefix":["openphacts","compound"],"maintainerEmails":["greeenify@gmail.com","ianwdunlop@gmail.com"],"logo":"http:\/\/biojs.net\/img\/logo.png","id":10787,"sourceCodeURL":["git:\/\/github.com\/openphacts\/openphacts-vis-compoundinfo.git"],"maintainers":["greenify","ianwdunlop","Openphacts"],"types":["Widget"],"suggestName":"openphacts-vis-compoundinfo","dateUpdated":[Mon Nov 09 21:01:42 PST 2015],"tags":["openphacts","compound","Bioinformatics"],"dependencies":["biojs-events: 0.0.4","js-class: 0.0.2","js-extend: 0.0.2","ops.js: >=6.0.1"],"_version_":1552363050365878272,"name":"openphacts-vis-compoundinfo","suggestNamePrefix":"openphacts-vis-compoundinfo","authorEmails":["info@openphactsfoundation.org"],"authors":["Openphacts"]},{"repo":"sourceforge","description":"Motivation: The recent revolution in sequencing technologies has led to an exponential growth of sequence data. As a result, most of the current bioinformatics tools become obsolete as they fail to scale with data. To tackle this 'data deluge', here we introduce the BioPig sequence analysis toolkit as one of the solutions that scale to data and computation. Results: We built BioPig on the Apache's Hadoop MapReduce system and the Pig data flow language. Compared with traditional serial and MPI-based algorithms, BioPig has three major advantages: first, BioPig's programmability greatly reduces development time for parallel bioinformatics applications; second, testing BioPig with up to 500 Gb sequences demonstrates that it scales automatically with size of data; and finally, BioPig can be ported without modification on many Hadoop infrastructures, as tested with Magellan system at National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center and the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud. In summary, BioPig represents a novel program framework with the potential to greatly accelerate data-intensive bioinformatics analysis.

However, surprisingly few published bioinformatics methods exist for the specific purpose of identifying somatic mutations from NGS data and existing tools are often inaccurate, yielding intolerably high false prediction rates. As such, the computational problem of accurately inferring somatic mutations from paired tumour\/normal NGS data remains an unsolved challenge. Results: We present the comparison of four standard supervised machine learning algorithms for the purpose of somatic SNV prediction in tumour\/normal NGS experiments. To evaluate these approaches (random forest, Bayesian additive regression tree, support vector machine and logistic regression), we constructed 106 features representing 3369 candidate somatic SNVs from 48 breast cancer genomes, originally predicted with naive methods and subsequently revalidated to establish ground truth labels. We trained the classifiers on this data (consisting of 1015 true somatic mutations and 2354 non-somatic mutation positions) and conducted a rigorous evaluation of these methods using a cross-validation framework and hold-out test NGS data from both exome capture and whole genome shotgun platforms. All learning algorithms employing predictive discriminative approaches with feature selection improved the predictive accuracy over standard approaches by statistically significant margins. In addition, using unsupervised clustering of the ground truth 'false positive' predictions, we noted several distinct classes and present evidence suggesting non-overlapping sources of technical artefacts illuminating important directions for future study.

Most existing methods for DNA sequence analysis rely on accurate sequences or genotypes. However, in applications of the next-generation sequencing (NGS), accurate genotypes may not be easily obtained (e.g. multi-sample low-coverage sequencing or somatic mutation discovery). These applications press for the development of new methods for analyzing sequence data with uncertainty. Results: We present a statistical framework for calling SNPs, discovering somatic mutations, inferring population genetical parameters and performing association tests directly based on sequencing data without explicit genotyping or linkage-based imputation. On real data, we demonstrate that our method achieves comparable accuracy to alternative methods for estimating site allele count, for inferring allele frequency spectrum and for association mapping.

Existing approaches, which detect CNVs for each individual in a trio independently, usually yield low-detection accuracy. Joint modeling approaches leveraging Mendelian transmission within the parent-offspring trio can be an efficient strategy to improve CNV detection accuracy. Results: In this study, we developed TrioCNV, a novel approach for jointly detecting CNVs in parent offspring trios from WGS data. Using negative binomial regression, we modeled the read depth signal while considering both GC content bias and mappability bias. Moreover, we incorporated the family relationship and used a hidden Markov model to jointly infer CNVs for three samples of a parent-offspring trio. Through application to both simulated data and a trio from 1000 Genomes Project, we showed that TrioCNV achieved superior performance than existing approaches.

process molecular structures and hence strongly rely not only on correct atomic coordinates but also on correct bond order information. For proteins and nucleic acids, bond orders can be easily deduced but this does not hold for other types of molecules like ligands. For ligands, bond order information is not always provided in molecular databases and thus a variety of approaches tackling this problem have been developed. In this work, we extend an ansatz proposed by Wang et al. that assigns connectivity-based penalty scores and tries to heuristically approximate its optimum. In this work, we present three efficient and exact solvers for the problem replacing the heuristic approximation scheme of the original approach: an A*, an ILP and an fixed-parameter approach (FPT) approach. Results: We implemented and evaluated the original implementation , our A*, ILP and FPT formulation on the MMFF94 validation suite and the KEGG Drug database. We show the benefit of computing exact solutions of the penalty minimization problem and the additional gain when computing all optimal (or even suboptimal) solutions. We close with a detailed comparison of our methods.

However, these existing rare variant detection methods are not able to identify which rare variants in a gene or a genetic region of all variants are associated with the complex diseases or traits. Once phenotypic associations of a gene or a genetic region are identified, the natural next step in the association study with sequencing data is to locate the susceptible rare variants within the gene or the genetic region. Results: In this article, we propose a power set-based statistical selection procedure that is able to identify the locations of the potentially susceptible rare variants within a disease-related gene or a genetic region. The selection performance of the proposed selection procedure was evaluated through simulation studies, where we demonstrated the feasibility and superior power over several comparable existing methods. In particular, the proposed method is able to handle the mixed effects when both risk and protective variants are present in a gene or a genetic region. The proposed selection procedure was also applied to the sequence data on the ANGPTL gene family from the Dallas Heart Study to identify potentially susceptible rare variants within the trait-related genes.

They have been used for hypothesis generation and guilt-by-association approaches for inferring functions of previously unknown genes. So far, the main platform for expression data has been DNA microarrays; however, the recent development of RNA-seq allows for higher accuracy and coverage of transcript populations. It is therefore important to assess the potential for biological investigation of coexpression networks derived from this novel technique in a condition-independent dataset. Results: We collected 65 publicly available Illumina RNA-seq high quality Arabidopsis thaliana samples and generated Pearson correlation coexpression networks. These networks were then compared with those derived from analogous microarray data. We show how Variance-Stabilizing Transformed (VST) RNA-seq data samples are the most similar to microarray ones, with respect to inter-sample variation, correlation coefficient distribution and network topological architecture. Microarray networks show a slightly higher score in biology derived quality assessments such as overlap with the known protein\u2013protein interaction network and edge ontological agreement. Different coexpression network centralities are investigated; in particular , we show how betweenness centrality is generally a positive marker for essential genes in A.thaliana, regardless of the platform originating the data. In the end, we focus on a specific gene network case, showing that although microarray data seem more suited for gene network reverse engineering, RNA-seq offers the great advantage of extending coexpression analyses to the entire transcriptome.","language":["Java"],"source":"Bioinformatics [Journal]","licenseUrls":null,"linkDescriptions":null,"linkUrls":["http:\/\/jung.sourceforge.net","http:\/\/www.neo4j.org","http:\/\/infos.korea.ac.kr\/berex).Contact","http:\/\/ilpubs.stanford.edu:8090\/422\/(8","http:\/\/bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org","http:\/\/www.usadellab.org\/cms\/index.php?page","http:\/\/erne.sourceforge.net","http:\/\/centilib.ipk-gatersleben.de\/Contact","http:\/\/acs.lbl.gov\/software\/colt","http:\/\/www.jfree.org\/jfreechart","http:\/\/bioinformatics.ust.hk\/BOOST.html","http:\/\/developer.download.nvidia.com\/compute\/cuda\/2_1\/toolkit\/docs\/NVIDIA_CUDA_Programming_Guide_2.1.pdf.Greene,C","http:\/\/www.kavrakilab.org\/atommetanetContact","http:\/\/www.research.att.com\/sw\/tools\/graphviz"],"dateCreated":[Fri Feb 01 18:00:36 PST 2013],"lastUpdatedMilliseconds":1472745682528,"suggestTag":["microarray coexpression networks","network","microarrays","genes","figs","data","coexpressions"],"suggestTagPrefix":["microarray coexpression networks","network","microarrays","genes","figs","data","coexpressions"],"maintainerEmails":null,"id":10830,"summary":["Comparative study of RNA-seq- and Microarray-derived coexpression networks in Arabidopsis thaliana\nbetweenness genes tend to be key network regulators (Joy et al.,\nthan the rest of the transcriptome in microarray-based coexpression networks (Mutwil et al., 2010).\nComparative study of RNA-seq- and Microarray-derived coexpression networks in Arabidopsis thaliana\ndegree alone, as stated before for degree in protein\u2013protein interaction networks (Wuchty, 2002), is not always a sufficient predictor for gene essentiality in RNA-seq networks, while it is a\nComparative study of RNA-seq- and Microarray-derived coexpression networks in Arabidopsis thaliana\nuse RNA-seq data collected from multiple tissues and experimental conditions for gene network reverse engineering."],"sourceCodeURL":["http:\/\/jung.sourceforge.net","http:\/\/erne.sourceforge.net"],"maintainers":["[{u'url': u'https:\/\/sourceforge.net\/u\/ybboey\/', u'name': u'Yan-Biao Boey'}, {u'url': u'https:\/\/sourceforge.net\/u\/offkey\/', u'name': u'D.

The development of next generation sequencing technology provides an efficient and powerful approach to rare variant detection. To identify genetic variations, the essential question is how to quantity the sequencing error rate in the data. Because of the advantage of easy implementation and the ability to integrate data from different sources, the empirical Bayes method is popularly employed to estimate the sequencing error rate for SNP detection. Results: We propose a novel statistical model to fit the observed non-reference allele frequency data, and utilize the empirical Bayes method for both genotyping and SNP detection, where an ECM algorithm is implemented to estimate the model parameters. The performance of our proposed method is investigated via simulations and real data analysis. It is shown that our method makes less genotype-call errors, and with the parameter estimates from the ECM algorithm, it attains high detection power with FDR being well controlled. Availability and implementation: The proposed algorithm is wrapped in the R package ebGenotyping, which can be downloaded from

Building on previously published work with the single sample SNV caller genotype model selection (GeMS), a multiple sample version of GeMS (MultiGeMS) is introduced. Unlike other popular multiple sample SNV callers, the MultiGeMS statistical model accounts for en-zymatic substitution sequencing errors. It also addresses the multiple testing problem endemic to multiple sample SNV calling and utilizes high performance computing (HPC) techniques. Results: A simulation study demonstrates that MultiGeMS ranks highest in precision among a selection of popular multiple sample SNV callers, while showing exceptional recall in calling common SNVs. Further, both simulation studies and real data analyses indicate that MultiGeMS is robust to low-quality data. We also demonstrate that accounting for enzymatic substitution sequencing errors not only improves SNV call precision at low mapping quality regions, but also improves recall at reference allele-dominated sites with high mapping quality.

processing features such as interpolation and other mathematical operations, and special features for ease of use by clinicians. Specifically, the SWI module in SPIN makes it possible to combine magnitude and phase images and create minimum intensity maps over an arbitrary range of the tissue of interest. We also have new features (over and above what is offered in the Siemens SWI product for the 3T TRIO) for performing anti-aliasing and special processing of high pass filtered phase images. The MRA module offers a region growing algorithm to find the vessel tree starting from a specific vessel, and has the ability to simulate vessel flow.

Accurate detection of de novo mutations from sequencing data is a critical step in trio-based genetic studies. Existing bioinformatic approaches usually yield high error rates due to sequencing artifacts and alignment issues, which may either miss true de novo mutations or call too many false ones, making downstream validation and analysis difficult. In particular , current approaches have much worse specificity than sensitivity, and developing effective filters to discriminate genuine from spurious de novo mutations remains an unsolved challenge. Results: In this article, we curated 59 sequence features in whole genome and exome alignment context which are considered to be relevant to discriminating true de novo mutations from artifacts, and then employed a machine-learning approach to classify candidates as true or false de novo mutations. Specifically, we built a classifier, named De Novo Mutation Filter (DNMFilter), using gradient boosting as the classification algorithm. We built the training set using experimentally validated true and false de novo mutations as well as collected false de novo mutations from an in-house large-scale exome-sequencing project. We evaluated DNMFilter's theoretical performance and investigated relative importance of different sequence features on the classification accuracy. Finally, we applied DNMFilter on our in-house whole exome trios and one CEU trio from the 1000 Genomes Project and found that DNMFilter could be coupled with commonly used de novo mutation detection approaches as an effective filtering approach to significantly reduce false discovery rate without sacrificing sensitivity.

Peptides, which partially mimic the interface area of one of the interacting proteins, are natural candidates to form protein\u2013peptide complexes competing with the original PPI. The prediction of such complexes is especially challenging due to the high flexibility of peptide conformations. Results: In this article, we present PepCrawler, a new tool for deriving binding peptides from protein\u2013protein complexes and prediction of peptide\u2013protein complexes, by performing high-resolution docking refinement and estimation of binding affinity. By using a fast path planning approach, PepCrawler rapidly generates large amounts of flexible peptide conformations, allowing backbone and side chain flexibility. A newly introduced binding energy funnel 'steepness score' was applied for the evaluation of the protein\u2013peptide complexes binding affinity. PepCrawler simulations predicted high binding affinity for native protein\u2013peptide complexes benchmark and low affinity for low-energy decoy complexes. In three cases, where wet lab data are available, the PepCrawler predictions were consistent with the data. Comparing to other state of the art flexible peptide\u2013protein structure prediction algorithms, our algorithm is very fast, and takes only minutes to run on a single PC.","language":["Python"],"source":"Bioinformatics [Journal]","licenseUrls":null,"linkDescriptions":null,"linkUrls":["http:\/\/jquery.com","http:\/\/www.scipy.org","http:\/\/fancybox.net).Interactive","http:\/\/sherekhan.bionmr.org.Contact","http:\/\/rubyonrails.org","http:\/\/matplotlib.sourceforge.net","http:\/\/bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org","http:\/\/protovis.org","http:\/\/bioinfo3d.cs.tau.ac.il\/PepCrawler\/Contact","http:\/\/matplotlib.sourceforge.net).Funding"],"dateCreated":[Thu Sep 01 04:03:12 PDT 2011],"lastUpdatedMilliseconds":1472695871087,"latest_version":["5 -

However, it is not yet clear how best to use this information to discover general rules or interaction patterns about structural protein\u2013protein interactions. Improving our ability to detect and exploit structural interaction patterns will help to provide a better 3D picture of the known protein interactome, and will help to guide docking-based predictions of the 3D structures of unsolved protein complexes. Results: This article presents KBDOCK, a 3D database approach for spatially clustering protein binding sites and for performing template-based (knowledge-based) protein docking. KBDOCK combines residue contact information from the 3DID database with the Pfam protein domain family classification together with coordinate data from the Protein Data Bank. This allows the 3D configurations of all known hetero domain\u2013domain interactions to be superposed and clustered for each Pfam family. We find that most Pfam domain families have up to four hetero binding sites, and over 60% of all domain families have just one hetero binding site. The utility of this approach for template-based docking is demonstrated using 73 complexes from the Protein Docking Benchmark. Overall, up to 45 out of 73 complexes may be modelled by direct homology to existing domain interfaces, and key binding site information is found for 24 of the 28 remaining complexes. These results show that KBDOCK can often provide useful information for predicting the structures of unknown protein complexes.","language":["JavaScript","Java"],"source":"Bioinformatics

However, most liquid chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry data analysis software lacks features that enable automated annotation and relative quantification of labelled metabolite peaks. Here, we describe mzMatch\u2013ISO, a new extension to the metabolomics analysis pipeline mzMatch.R. Results: Targeted and untargeted isotope profiling using mzMatch\u2013 ISO provides a convenient visual summary of the quality and quantity of labelling for every metabolite through four types of diagnostic plots that show (i) the chromatograms of the isotope peaks of each compound in each sample group; (ii) the ratio of mono-isotopic and labelled peaks indicating the fraction of labelling; (iii) the average peak area of mono-isotopic and labelled peaks in each sample group; and (iv) the trend in the relative amount of labelling in a predetermined isotopomer. To aid further statistical analyses, the values used for generating these plots are also provided as a tab-delimited file. We demonstrate the power and versatility of mzMatch\u2013ISO by analysing a 13 C-labelled metabolome dataset from trypanosomal parasites. Availability: mzMatch.R and mzMatch\u2013ISO are available free of charge from http:\/\/mzmatch.sourceforge.net and can be used on Linux and Windows platforms running the latest version of R.

The structural data of multi-domain PPIs reveal the domain pair (or pairs) that mediate a PPI, and implicitly also the domain pairs that are not involved in the interaction. By analyzing such data, preference relations between domain pairs as interaction mediators may be revealed. Results: Here, we analyze the differential use of domain pairs as mediators of stable interactions based on structurally solved multi-domain protein complexes. Our analysis revealed domain pairs that are preferentially used as interaction mediators and domain pairs that rarely or never mediate interaction, independent of the proteins' context. Between these extremes, there are domain pairs that mediate protein interaction in some protein contexts, while in other contexts different domain pairs predominate over them. By describing the preference relations between domain pairs as a network, we uncovered partial order and transitivity in these relations, which we further exploited for predicting interaction-mediating domains. The preferred domain pairs and the ones over which they predominate differ in several properties, but these differences cannot yet determine explicitly what underlies the differential use of domain pairs as interaction mediators. One property that stood up was the overabundance of homotypic interactions among the preferred domain pairs, supporting previous suggestions on the advantages in the use of domain self-interaction for mediating protein interactions. Finally, we show a possible association between the preferred domain pairs and the function of the complex where they reside.","language":["Python","C","Tcl"],"source":"Bioinformatics [Journal]","licenseUrls":null,"linkDescriptions":null,"linkUrls":["http:\/\/sourceforge.net\/projects\/pymol","http:\/\/bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org","http:\/\/www.motorprotein.de\/genepainter","http:\/\/pymol.sourceforge.net","http:\/\/www.bioinsilico.org\/MVORFFIPSupplementary","http:\/\/www.jmol.org","http:\/\/www.bioinsilico.org\/MVORFFIP","http:\/\/pymol.sourceforge.net)with","http:\/\/pymol.sourceforge.net)2.2.2","http:\/\/www.bioinsilico.org\/PIPRED.Contact","http:\/\/www.bioinsilico.org\/PIPRED.2.2","http:\/\/www.bioinformatics.org\/cmview","http:\/\/pymol.sourceforge.net\/.de","http:\/\/jaligner.sourceforge.net.Pietal,M.J"],"dateCreated":[Sat Aug 28 17:12:56 PDT 2010],"latest_version":["5 - Production\/Stable"],"lastUpdatedMilliseconds":1472711466167,"suggestTag":["protein domain pairs","interactions","proteins","paired","bioinformatics","domains","networks"],"suggestTagPrefix":["protein domain pairs","interactions","proteins","paired","bioinformatics","domains","networks"],"maintainerEmails":null,"id":10899,"summary":["Preferential use of protein domain pairs as interaction mediators:\ndomain pairs that are used as interaction mediators (Finn et al.,\nsuch data, preference relations between domain pairs as interaction\nof domain pairs as interaction mediators.\nPreferential use of protein domain pairs as interaction mediators\ndomain pairs that do not mediate the interaction.\nrelations of domain pairs as interaction mediators are consistent,\nPreferential use of protein domain pairs as interaction mediators\nof domain pair relations based on 4\/5 of the protein interactions\ndomain pair is preferred and mediates the interaction.\nbetween domain pairs as interaction mediators.\nPreferential use of protein domain pairs as interaction mediators"],"sourceCodeURL":["http:\/\/pymol.sourceforge.net"],"maintainers":["[{u'url': u'https:\/\/sourceforge.net\/u\/fmaia\/', u'name': u'Filipe Maia'}, {u'url': u'https:\/\/sourceforge.net\/u\/herc111\/', u'name': u'Silverstein'}, {u'url': u'https:\/\/sourceforge.net\/u\/wdelano\/', u'name': u'Warren L.

All of the original Cellerator arrows, which represent reactions ranging from mass action, Michales\u2013Menten\u2013Henri (MMH) and Gene-Regulation (GRN) to Monod\u2013Wyman\u2013Changeaux (MWC), user defined reactions and enzymatic expansions (KMech), were previously represented with the Mathematica extended character set. These are now typed as reaction-like commands in ASCII text files that are read by Pycellerator, which includes a Python command line interface (CLI), a Python application programming interface (API) and an iPython notebook interface. Results: Cellerator reaction arrows are now input in text files. The arrows are parsed by Pycellerator and translated into differential equations in Python, and Python code is automatically generated to solve the system. Time courses are produced by executing the auto-generated Python code. Users have full freedom to modify the solver and utilize the complete set of standard Python tools.

One way is to approach this problem sitewise, i.e. to find differentially methylated positions (DMPs). However, it has been shown that methylation is regulated in longer genomic regions. So it is more desirable to identify differentially methylated regions (DMRs) instead of DMPs. The new high coverage arrays, like Illuminas 450k platform, make it possible at a reasonable cost. Few tools exist for DMR identification from this type of data, but there is no standard approach. Results: We propose a novel method for DMR identification that detects the region boundaries according to the minimum description length (MDL) principle, essentially solving the problem of model selection. The significance of the regions is established using linear mixed models. Using both simulated and large publicly available methylation datasets, we compare seqlm performance to alternative approaches. We demonstrate that it is both more sensitive and specific than competing methods. This is achieved with minimal parameter tuning and, surprisingly, quickest running time of all the tried methods. Finally, we show that the regional differential methylation patterns identified on sparse array data are confirmed by higher resolution sequencing approaches.

The length of the strings is from 25 to 1000, depending on the DNA sequencing technologies. However, many DNA assemblers using overlap graphs suffer from the need for too much time and space in constructing the graphs. It is nearly impossible for these DNA assemblers to handle the huge amount of data produced by the next-generation sequencing technologies where the number n of strings could be several billions. If the overlap graph is explicitly stored, it would require (n 2) memory, which could be prohibitive in practice when n is greater than a hundred million. In this article, we propose a novel data structure using which the overlap graph can be compactly stored. This data structure requires only linear time to construct and and linear memory to store. Results: For a given set of input strings (also called reads), we can informally define an exact-match overlap graph as follows. Each read is represented as a node in the graph and there is an edge between two nodes if the corresponding reads overlap sufficiently. A formal description follows. The maximal exact-match overlap of two strings x and y, denoted by ov max (x,y), is the longest string which is a suffix of x and a prefix of y. The exact-match overlap graph of n given strings of length is an edge-weighted graph in which each vertex is associated with a string and there is an edge (x, y) of weight ω = −|ov max (x,y)| if and only if ω ≤ λ, where |ov max (x,y)| is the length of ov max (x,y) and λ is a given threshold. In this article, we show that the exact-match overlap graphs can be represented by a compact data structure that can be stored using at most (2λ−1)(2logn++logλ)n bits with a guarantee that the basic operation of accessing an edge takes O(logλ) time. We also propose two algorithms for constructing the data structure for the exact-match overlap graph. The first algorithm runs in O(λλnlogn) worse-case time and requires O(λ) extra memory. The second one runs in O(λλn) time and requires O(n) extra memory. Our experimental results on a huge amount of simulated data from sequence assembly show that the data structure can be constructed efficiently in time and memory.

It is also known that probabilistic alignments based on marginal probabilities (e.g. aligned-column and\/or gap probabilities) provide more accurate alignment than conventional maximum score-based alignment. There exists, however, no study about probabilistic alignment that considers quality scores explicitly, although the method is expected to be useful in SNP\/indel callers and bisulfite mapping, because accurate estimation of aligned columns or gaps is important in those analyses. Results: In this study, we propose methods of probabilistic alignment that consider quality scores of (one of) the sequences as well as a usual score matrix. The method is based on posterior decoding techniques in which various marginal probabilities are computed from a probabilistic model of alignments with quality scores, and can arbitrarily trade-off sensitivity and positive predictive value (PPV) of prediction (aligned columns and gaps). The method is directly applicable to read mapping (alignment) toward accurate detection of SNPs and indels. Several computational experiments indicated that probabilistic alignments can estimate aligned columns and gaps accurately, compared with other mapping algorithms e.g. SHRiMP2, Stampy, BWA and Novoalign. The study also suggested that our approach yields favorable precision for SNP\/indel calling.","language":["C"],"source":"Bioinformatics [Journal]","licenseUrls":null,"linkDescriptions":null,"linkUrls":["http:\/\/www.pacificbiosciences.com","http:\/\/bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org","https:\/\/code.google.com\/p\/slidesortbpr\/.Contact","http:\/\/sourceforge.net\/projects\/dnaa","http:\/\/last.cbrc.jp","http:\/\/www.well.ox.ac.uk\/projectstampy","http:\/\/www.novocraft.com\/),SHRiMP2","http:\/\/last.cbrc.jp.Contact","http:\/\/www.broadinstitute.org\/gsa\/wiki\/index.php\/Base_quality_score_recalibration"],"dateCreated":[Wed Oct 05 22:45:18 PDT 2011],"latest_version":["3 - Alpha"],"lastUpdatedMilliseconds":1472740118161,"suggestTag":["scoring","sequencers","mapping","maps","reads","bioinformatics","alignments"],"suggestTagPrefix":["scoring","sequencers","mapping","maps","reads","bioinformatics","alignments"],"maintainerEmails":null,"id":10942,"summary":["Probabilistic alignments with quality scores: an application to\n(Hamada et al., 2011) (we call it \u2018Aligned column accuracy\u2019,\nnot probabilistic alignments, while considering quality scores; (Frith\net al., 2010b) employed a probabilistic (γ-centroid) alignment\npropose two probabilistic alignment methods that consider quality\nalignment that consider quality scores of (one of) the sequences\nProbabilistic alignments with quality scores\nProbabilistic alignments with quality scores\nour implementation, the \u2018Mapping accuracy\u2019 of probabilistic alignments is\nscore alignment [see Hamada et al.\nProbabilistic alignments with quality scores\nProbabilistic alignments with quality scores\nalignments considering quality scores of both sequences will be\n\u2018Gap accuracy\u2019 in read alignment."],"sourceCodeURL":["http:\/\/sourceforge.net\/projects\/dnaa"],"maintainers":["[{u'url': u'https:\/\/sourceforge.net\/u\/userid-2014892\/', u'name': u'Bret Harry'}, {u'url': u'https:\/\/sourceforge.net\/u\/driodeiros\/', u'name': u'David Rio Deiros'}, {u'url': u'https:\/\/sourceforge.net\/u\/oiiio\/', u'name': u'gareth'}, {u'url': u'https:\/\/sourceforge.net\/u\/nilshomer\/', u'name': u'Nils Homer'}, {u'url': u'https:\/\/sourceforge.net\/u\/joachimjacob\/', u'name': u'Joachim Jacob'}, {u'url': u'https:\/\/sourceforge.net\/u\/kmsquire\/', u'name': u'Kevin Squire'}]","[{u'url': u'https:\/\/sourceforge.net\/u\/nilshomer\/', u'name': u'Nils Homer'}, {u'url': u'https:\/\/sourceforge.net\/u\/joachimjacob\/', u'name': u'Joachim Jacob'}, {u'url': u'https:\/\/sourceforge.net\/u\/oiiio\/', u'name': u'gareth'}, {u'url': u'https:\/\/sourceforge.net\/u\/userid-2014892\/', u'name': u'Bret Harry'}, {u'url': u'https:\/\/sourceforge.net\/u\/kmsquire\/', u'name': u'Kevin Squire'}, {u'url': u'https:\/\/sourceforge.net\/u\/driodeiros\/', u'name': u'David Rio Deiros'}]"],"funding":["[Agency not found, 221S002]"],"suggestName":"dnaa","domains":["Metagenomics"],"acknowledgements":[" We are grateful to Tatsuo Kitahashi (INTEC Inc.) for providing technical support for this project.

The use of these systems for routine analysis requires scalable and robust software for data management of large datasets. Software is also needed to simplify data management and make large-scale bioinformatics analysis accessible and reproducible to a wide class of target users. Results: We have developed a workflow management system named Ergatis that enables users to build, execute and monitor pipelines for computational analysis of genomics data. Ergatis contains preconfigured components and template pipelines for a number of common bioinformatics tasks such as prokaryotic genome annotation and genome comparisons. Outputs from many of these components can be loaded into a Chado relational database. Ergatis was designed to be accessible to a broad class of users and provides a user friendly, web-based interface. Ergatis supports high-throughput batch processing on distributed compute clusters and has been used for data management in a number of genome annotation and comparative genomics projects.

As a result, there is now a pronounced bioinformatic bottleneck. The general model organism database (GMOD) tool kit (http:\/\/gmod.org) has produced a number of resources aimed at addressing this issue. It lacks, however, a robust online solution that can deploy heterogeneous data and software within a Web content management system (CMS). Results: We present a bioinformatic framework for the Drupal CMS. It consists of three modules. First, GMOD-DBSF is an application programming interface module for the Drupal CMS that simplifies the programming of bioinformatic Drupal modules. Second, the Drupal Bioinformatic Software Bench (biosoftware_bench) allows for a rapid and secure deployment of bioinformatic software. An innovative graphical user interface (GUI) guides both use and administration of the software, including the secure provision of pre-publication datasets. Third, we present genes4all_experiment, which exemplifies how our work supports the wider research community. Conclusion: Given the infrastructure presented here, the Drupal CMS may become a powerful new tool set for bioinformaticians. The GMOD-DBSF base module is an expandable community resource that decreases development time of Drupal modules for bioinformatics. The biosoftware_bench module can already enhance biologists' ability to mine their own data. The genes4all_experiment module has already been responsible for archiving of more than 150 studies of RNAi from Lepidoptera, which were previously unpublished.","source":"Bioinformatics [Journal]","licenseUrls":null,"linkDescriptions":null,"linkUrls":["http:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licenses\/by\/4.0\/),which","http:\/\/www.ebi.ac.uk\/fg\/sym\/submit","http:\/\/www.ebi.ac.uk\/fg\/sym.Contact","http:\/\/miare.sourceforge.net\/HomePage","http:\/\/www.crcpress.com\/product\/isbn\/9781466590953.Jupp,S","http:\/\/drupal.org\/project\/tabs","http:\/\/gmod.org","http:\/\/drupal.org","http:\/\/miare.sourceforge.net","http:\/\/bioperl.org;Stajich","http:\/\/gmod.org\/gmod-dbsf","http:\/\/drupal.org\/project\/jquery","http:\/\/gmod.org\/wiki\/Tripal","http:\/\/gmod-dbsf.googlecode.com\/files\/GMOD-DBSF_dev_manual_1.0.pdf","http:\/\/gmod.org\/Tripal","http:\/\/www.nescent.org\/informatics\/software.php","http:\/\/code.google.com\/p\/dynatree","http:\/\/scivee.tv","http:\/\/gmod.org\/wiki\/GMOD_Users","http:\/\/drupal.org\/project\/services","http:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licenses\/by-nc\/2.5","http:\/\/bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org","http:\/\/egressive.com\/article\/who-uses-drupal).This","http:\/\/gmod-dbsf.googlecode.comContact","http:\/\/turnkey.sourceforge.net"],"dateCreated":[Sat Oct 23 17:13:41 PDT 2010],"lastUpdatedMilliseconds":1472734408558,"latest_version":["2 - Pre-Alpha"],"suggestTag":["genomics","functionalities","drupal","bioinformatics","databasing","software"],"suggestTagPrefix":["genomics","functionalities","drupal","bioinformatics","databasing","software"],"maintainerEmails":null,"id":10957,"summary":["The GMOD Drupal Bioinformatic Server Framework\nbioinformatic Drupal modules.\nand Drupal database schemas; and (iv) providing other, generic, functions\nresulted in a large active community of users and developers (e.g. see http:\/\/egressive.com\/article\/who-uses-drupal).\nFirst, GMOD-DBSF is a generic function framework for Drupal\nGMOD Drupal Bioinformatic Server Framework\nseamless integration with core Drupal data: e.g. a resource_roles allows\nDrupal for bioinformatics using GMOD-DBSF\nlocal Drupal database (or make use of the gmod_dbsf_is_chado()\nbiosoftware_bench software server to allow users to upload datasets\nGMOD Drupal Bioinformatic Server Framework\nfunctions provided by the core and contributed modules, the Drupal"],"sourceCodeURL":["http:\/\/gmod.org","http:\/\/drupal.org","http:\/\/miare.sourceforge.net","http:\/\/gmod-dbsf.googlecode.com\/files\/GMOD-DBSF_dev_manual_1.0.pdf","http:\/\/www.nescent.org\/informatics\/software.php","http:\/\/code.google.com\/p\/dynatree","http:\/\/bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org","http:\/\/gmod-dbsf.googlecode.comContact","http:\/\/turnkey.sourceforge.net"],"maintainers":["[{u'url': u'https:\/\/sourceforge.net\/u\/nbinns\/', u'name': u'Nigel Binns'}]"],"funding":["[Seventh Framework Programme, FP7\/2007-2013]","[Seventh Framework Programme, FP7\/2007-2013]"],"suggestName":"miare","acknowledgements":[" We would like to thank Beate Neumann, Staffan Stromblad, Benny Geiger, Jean-Karim Heriche and other Systems Microscopy consortium members for helpful comments, critical suggestions and fruitful discussions.

Thanks to comparative metatranscriptomics, the cellular functions that are deregulated by the microbiome in disease can now be computationally explored. Unlike gene-centric approaches, pathway-based methods provide a systemic view of such functions; however, they typically consider each pathway in isolation and in its entirety. They can therefore overlook the key differences that (i) span multiple pathways, (ii) contain bidirectionally deregulated components, (iii) are confined to a pathway region. To capture these properties, computational methods that reach beyond the scope of predefined pathways are needed. Results: By integrating an existing module discovery algorithm into comparative metatranscrip-tomic analysis, we developed metaModules, a novel computational framework for automated identification of the key functional differences between health-and disease-associated communities. Using this framework, we recovered significantly deregulated subnetworks that were indeed recognized to be involved in two well-studied, microbiome-mediated oral diseases, such as butanoate production in periodontal disease and metabolism of sugar alcohols in dental caries. More importantly , our results indicate that our method can be used for hypothesis generation based on automated discovery of novel, disease-related functional subnetworks, which would otherwise require extensive and laborious manual assessment.

This is mainly due to the lack of publicly available tools for the visualization of this type of information. Here we present an R package called GOplot, based on ggplot2, for enhanced graphical representation. Our package takes the output of any general enrichment analysis and generates plots at different levels of detail: from a general overview to identify the most enriched categories (bar plot, bubble plot) to a more detailed view displaying different types of information for molecules in a given set of categories (circle plot, chord plot, cluster plot). The package provides a deeper insight into omics data and allows scientists to generate insightful plots with only a few lines of code to easily communicate the findings. Availability and Implementation: The R package GOplot is available via CRAN-The Comprehensive R Archive Network: http:\/\/cran.r-project.org\/web\/packages\/GOplot.

A comprehensive ontology allowing such descriptions is therefore required. Results: EDAM is an ontology of bioinformatics operations (tool or workflow functions), types of data and identifiers, application domains and data formats. EDAM supports semantic annotation of diverse entities such as Web services, databases, programmatic libraries, standalone tools, interactive applications, data schemas, datasets and publications within bioinformatics. EDAM applies to organizing and finding suitable tools and data and to automating their integration into complex applications or workflows. It includes over 2200 defined concepts and has successfully been used for annotations and implementations. Availability: The latest stable version of EDAM is available in OWL format from http:\/\/edamontology.org\/EDAM.owl and in OBO format from http:\/\/edamontology.org\/EDAM.obo.

However, the storage and analysis of transcriptome information from different NGS platforms is still a significant bottleneck, leading to a delay in data dissemination and subsequent biological understanding. Especially database interfaces with transcriptome analysis modules going beyond mere read counts are missing. Here, we present the Transcriptome Analysis and Comparison Explorer (T-ACE), a tool designed for the organization and analysis of large sequence datasets, and especially suited for transcriptome projects of non-model organisms with little or no a priori sequence information. T-ACE offers a TCL-based interface, which accesses a PostgreSQL database via a php-script. Within T-ACE, information belonging to single sequences or contigs, such as annotation or read coverage, is linked to the respective sequence and immediately accessible. Sequences and assigned information can be searched via keyword-or BLAST-search. Additionally, T-ACE provides within and between transcriptome analysis modules on the level of expression, GO terms, KEGG pathways and protein domains. Results are visualized and can be easily exported for external analysis. We developed T-ACE for laboratory environments, which have only a limited amount of bioinformatics support, and for collaborative projects in which different partners work on the same dataset from different locations or platforms (Windows\/Linux\/MacOS). For laboratories with some experience in bioinformatics and programming, the low complexity of the database structure and open-source code provides a framework that can be customized according to the different needs of the user and transcriptome project.

Although a large number of algorithms for computing a multiple sequence alignment have been designed, the efficient computation of highly accurate multiple alignments is still a challenge. Results: We present MSAProbs, a new and practical multiple alignment algorithm for protein sequences. The design of MSAProbs is based on a combination of pair hidden Markov models and partition functions to calculate posterior probabilities. Furthermore, two critical bioinformatics techniques, namely weighted probabilistic consistency transformation and weighted profile\u2013profile alignment, are incorporated to improve alignment accuracy. Assessed using the popular benchmarks: BAliBASE, PREFAB, SABmark and OXBENCH, MSAProbs achieves statistically significant accuracy improvements over the existing top performing aligners, including ClustalW, MAFFT, MUSCLE, ProbCons and Probalign. Furthermore, MSAProbs is optimized for multi-core CPUs by employing a multi-threaded design, leading to a competitive execution time compared to other aligners.

However, surprisingly few published bioinformatics methods exist for the specific purpose of identifying somatic mutations from NGS data and existing tools are often inaccurate, yielding intolerably high false prediction rates. As such, the computational problem of accurately inferring somatic mutations from paired tumour\/normal NGS data remains an unsolved challenge. Results: We present the comparison of four standard supervised machine learning algorithms for the purpose of somatic SNV prediction in tumour\/normal NGS experiments. To evaluate these approaches (random forest, Bayesian additive regression tree, support vector machine and logistic regression), we constructed 106 features representing 3369 candidate somatic SNVs from 48 breast cancer genomes, originally predicted with naive methods and subsequently revalidated to establish ground truth labels. We trained the classifiers on this data (consisting of 1015 true somatic mutations and 2354 non-somatic mutation positions) and conducted a rigorous evaluation of these methods using a cross-validation framework and hold-out test NGS data from both exome capture and whole genome shotgun platforms. All learning algorithms employing predictive discriminative approaches with feature selection improved the predictive accuracy over standard approaches by statistically significant margins.

Tandem Repeats (TRs) constitute a large class of repetitive sequences that are originated via phenomena such as replication slippage and are characterized by close spatial contiguity. They play an important role in several molecular regulatory mechanisms, and also in several diseases (e.g. in the group of trinucleotide repeat disorders). While for TRs with a low or medium level of divergence the current methods are rather effective, the problem of detecting TRs with higher divergence (fuzzy TRs) is still open. The detection of fuzzy TRs is propaedeutic to enriching our view of their role in regulatory mechanisms and diseases. Fuzzy TRs are also important as tools to shed light on the evolutionary history of the genome, where higher divergence correlates with more remote duplication events. Results: We have developed an algorithm (christened TRStalker) with the aim of detecting efficiently TRs that are hard to detect because of their inherent fuzziness, due to high levels of base substitutions, insertions and deletions. To attain this goal, we developed heuristics to solve a Steiner version of the problem for which the fuzziness is measured with respect to a motif string not necessarily present in the input string.

Species trees provide insight into basic biology, including the mechanisms of evolution and how it modifies biomolecular function and structure, biodiversity and co-evolution between genes and species. Yet, gene trees often differ from species trees, creating challenges to species tree estimation. One of the most frequent causes for conflicting topologies between gene trees and species trees is incomplete lineage sorting (ILS), which is modelled by the multi-species coalescent. While many methods have been developed to estimate species trees from multiple genes, some which have statistical guarantees under the multi-species coalescent model, existing methods are too computationally intensive for use with genome-scale analyses or have been shown to have poor accuracy under some realistic conditions. Results: We present ASTRAL, a fast method for estimating species trees from multiple genes. ASTRAL is statistically consistent, can run on datasets with thousands of genes and has outstanding accuracy\u2014 improving on MP-EST and the population tree from BUCKy, two statistically consistent leading coalescent-based methods. ASTRAL is often more accurate than concatenation using maximum likelihood, except when ILS levels are low or there are too few gene trees.

Results: We have developed a computational approach, called SNPlice, for identifying cis-acting, splice-modulating variants from RNA-seq datasets. SNPlice mines RNA-seq datasets to find reads that span single-nucleotide variant (SNV) loci and nearby splice junctions, assessing the co-occurrence of variants and molecules that remain unspliced at nearby exon\u2013intron boundaries. Hence, SNPlice highlights variants preferentially occurring on intron-containing molecules, possibly resulting from altered splicing. To illustrate co-occurrence of variant nucleotide and exon\u2013intron boundary, allele-specific sequencing was used. SNPlice results are generally consistent with splice-prediction tools, but also indicate splice-modulating elements missed by other algorithms. SNPlice can be applied to identify variants that correlate with unexpected splicing events, and to measure the splice-modulating potential of canonical splice-site SNVs.

Strand-specific reads allow for detection of antisense events and a higher resolution of expression profiles enabling extension of current transcript annotations. However, applications making use of this strandedness information are still scarce. Results: Here we present a tool (Janus), which focuses on the identification of transcriptional active regions in antisense orientation to known and novel transcribed elements of the genome. Janus can compare the antisense events of multiple samples and assigns scores to identify mutual expression of either transcript in a sense\/ antisense pair, which could hint to regulatory mechanisms. Janus is able to make use of single-nucleotide variant (SNV) and methylation data, if available, and reports the sense to antisense ratio of regions in the vicinity of the identified genetic and epigenetic variation. Janus interrogates positions of heterozygous SNVs to identify strand-specific allelic imbalance.

Large-scale MeSH indexing has two challenging aspects: the citation side and MeSH side. For the citation side, all existing methods, including Medical Text Indexer (MTI) by National Library of Medicine and the state-of-the-art method, MeSHLabeler, deal with text by bag-of-words, which cannot capture semantic and context-dependent information well. Methods: We propose DeepMeSH that incorporates deep semantic information for large-scale MeSH indexing. It addresses the two challenges in both citation and MeSH sides. The citation side challenge is solved by a new deep semantic representation, D2V-TFIDF, which concatenates both sparse and dense semantic representations. The MeSH side challenge is solved by using the 'learn-ing to rank' framework of MeSHLabeler, which integrates various types of evidence generated from the new semantic representation. Results: DeepMeSH achieved a Micro F-measure of 0.6323, 2% higher than 0.6218 of MeSHLabeler and 12% higher than 0.5637 of MTI, for BioASQ3 challenge data with 6000 citations.","language":["C++","Java"],"source":"Bioinformatics [Journal]","licenseUrls":null,"linkDescriptions":null,"linkUrls":["http:\/\/www.nlm.nih.gov\/mesh\/meshhome.html","http:\/\/sourceforge.net\/p\/lemur\/wiki\/RankLib","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/books\/NBK25499","http:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licenses\/by-nc\/4.0\/),which","http:\/\/www.nlm.nih.gov\/pubs\/factsheets\/medline.html","http:\/\/bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org","http:\/\/www.nlm.nih.gov\/pubs\/factsheets\/mesh.html","http:\/\/www.nlm.nih.gov\/bsd\/bsd_key.html","http:\/\/bioasq.org","http:\/\/datamining-iip.fudan.edu.cn\/service\/DrugE-RankContact","http:\/\/www.rdkit.org\/.Table","http:\/\/sourceforge.net\/p\/lemur\/wiki\/RankLib\/.cross-validation","http:\/\/www.aueb.gr\/users\/ion\/docs\/jbms_dense_vectors.pdfLe,Q","http:\/\/www.nlm.nih.gov\/pubs\/factsheets\/mesh.html)by","http:\/\/radimrehurek.com\/gensim","http:\/\/sourceforge.net\/p\/lemur\/wiki\/RankLib\/)to"],"dateCreated":[Wed Jun 15 08:43:52 PDT 2016],"latest_version":["5 -

Whole-genome and-exome sequencing on parent\u2013off-spring trios is a powerful approach to identifying disease-associated genes by detecting de novo mutations in patients. Accurate detection of de novo mutations from sequencing data is a critical step in trio-based genetic studies. Existing bioinformatic approaches usually yield high error rates due to sequencing artifacts and alignment issues, which may either miss true de novo mutations or call too many false ones, making downstream validation and analysis difficult. In particular , current approaches have much worse specificity than sensitivity, and developing effective filters to discriminate genuine from spurious de novo mutations remains an unsolved challenge. Results: In this article, we curated 59 sequence features in whole genome and exome alignment context which are considered to be relevant to discriminating true de novo mutations from artifacts, and then employed a machine-learning approach to classify candidates as true or false de novo mutations. Specifically, we built a classifier, named De Novo Mutation Filter (DNMFilter), using gradient boosting as the classification algorithm. We built the training set using experimentally validated true and false de novo mutations as well as collected false de novo mutations from an in-house large-scale exome-sequencing project. We evaluated DNMFilter's theoretical performance and investigated relative importance of different sequence features on the classification accuracy. Finally, we applied DNMFilter on our in-house whole exome trios and one CEU trio from the 1000 Genomes Project and found that DNMFilter could be coupled with commonly used de novo mutation detection approaches as an effective filtering approach to significantly reduce false discovery rate without sacrificing sensitivity.

Since true differential expression status is often unknown in experimental datasets, artificially constructed datasets must be utilized, either by generating costly spike-in experiments or by simulating RNA-seq data. Results: Polyester is an R package designed to simulate RNA-seq data, beginning with an experimental design and ending with collections of RNA-seq reads. Its main advantage is the ability to simulate reads indicating isoform-level differential expression across biological replicates for a variety of experimental designs. Data generated by Polyester is a reasonable approximation to real RNA-seq data and standard differential expression workflows can recover differential expression set in the simulation by the user.

Despite the advances in sequencing speed, the computational discovery of structural variants is not yet standard. It is likely that many variants have remained undiscovered in most sequenced individuals. Results: Here, we present a novel internal segment size based approach , which organizes all, including concordant, reads into a read alignment graph, where max-cliques represent maximal contradiction-free groups of alignments. A novel algorithm then enumerates all max-cliques and statistically evaluates them for their potential to reflect insertions or deletions. For the first time in the literature, we compare a large range of state-of-the-art approaches using simulated Illumina reads from a fully annotated genome and present relevant performance statistics. We achieve superior performance, in particular , for deletions or insertions (indels) of length 20\u2013100 nt. This has been previously identified as a remaining major challenge in structural variation discovery, in particular, for insert size based approaches. In this size range, we even outperform split-read aligners. We achieve competitive results also on biological data, where our method is the only one to make a substantial amount of correct predictions, which, additionally, are disjoint from those by split-read aligners.

small non-coding RNAs (sncRNAs) such as miRNAs, snoRNAs and tRNAs get further processed into putatively active smaller RNA species. Their roles, genetic profiles and underlying processing mechanisms are only partially understood. To find their quantities and characteristics, a proper annotation is essential. Here, we present FlaiMapper, a method that extracts and annotates the locations of sncRNA-derived RNAs (sncdRNAs). These sncdRNAs are often detected in sequencing data and observed as fragments of their precursor sncRNA. Using small RNA-seq read alignments, FlaiMapper is able to annotate fragments primarily by peak detection on the start and end position densities followed by filtering and a reconstruction process. Results: To assess performance of FlaiMapper, we used independent publicly available small RNA-seq data. We were able to detect fragments representing putative sncdRNAs from nearly all types of sncRNA, including 97.8% of the annotated miRNAs in miRBase that have supporting reads. Comparison of FlaiMapper-predicted boundaries of miRNAs with miRBase entries demonstrated that 89% of the start and 54% of the end positions are identical. Additional benchmarking showed that FlaiMapper is superior in performance compared with existing software. Further analysis indicated a variety of characteristics in the fragments, including sequence motifs and relations with RNA interacting factors. These characteristics set a good basis for further research on sncdRNAs.

Most currently available tools are designed specifically for human genomes, with comparatively little literature devoted to CNVs in pro-karyotic organisms. However, there are several idiosyncrasies in prokaryotic WGS data. This work proposes a step-by-step approach for detection and quantification of copy number variants specifically aimed at prokaryotes. Results: After aligning WGS reads to a reference genome, we count the individual reads in a sliding window and normalize these counts for bias introduced by differences in GC content. We then investigate the coverage in two fundamentally different ways: (i) Employing a Hidden Markov Model and (ii) by repeated sampling with replacement (bootstrapping) on each individual gene. The latter bypasses the complex problem of breakpoint determination. To demonstrate our method, we apply it to real and simulated WGS data and benchmark it against two popular methods for CNV detection. The proposed methodology will in some cases represent a significant jump in accuracy from other current methods.
