In the post-genomic era, the annotation of protein function facilitates the understanding of various biological processes. To extend the range of function annotation methods to the twilight zone of sequence identity, we have developed approaches that exploit both protein tertiary structure and/or protein sequence evolutionary relationships. To serve the scientific community, we have integrated the structure prediction tools, TASSER, TASSER-Lite and METATASSER, and the functional inference tools, FINDSITE, a structure-based algorithm for binding site prediction, Gene Ontology molecular function inference and ligand screening, EFICAz 2 , a sequence-based approach to enzyme function inference and DBD-hunter, an algorithm for predicting DNA-binding proteins and associated DNA-binding residues, into a unified web resource, Protein Structure and Function prediction Resource (PSiFR).
