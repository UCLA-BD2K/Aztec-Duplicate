Motivation: High-throughput nucleotide sequencing technologies provide large amounts of quantitative genomic data at nucleotide resolution, which are important for the present and future biomedical researches; for example differential analysis of base-level RNA expression data will improve our understanding of transcriptome, including both coding and non-coding genes. However, most studies of these data have relied on existing genome annotations and thus are limited to the analysis of known transcripts. Results: In this article, we propose a novel method based on a marked point process model to find differentially expressed genomic regions of arbitrary length without using genome annotations. The presented method conducts a statistical test for differential analysis in regions of various lengths at each nucleotide and searches the optimal configuration of the regions by using a Monte Carlo simulation. We applied the proposed method to both synthetic and real genomic data, and their results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.
