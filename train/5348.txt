Motivation: Complex interactions among alleles often drive differences in inherited properties including disease predisposition. Isolating the effects of these interactions requires phasing information that is difficult to measure or infer. Furthermore, prevalent sequencing technologies used in the essential first step of determining a haplotype limit the range of that step to the span of reads, namely hundreds of bases. With the advent of pseudo-long read technologies, observable partial haplotypes can span several orders of magnitude more. Yet, measuring whole-genome-single-individual haplotypes remains a challenge. A different view of whole genome measurement addresses the 3D structure of the genomeâ with great development of Hi-C techniques in recent years. A shortcoming of current Hi-C, however, is the difficulty in inferring information that is specific to each of a pair of homologous chromosomes. Results: In this work, we develop a robust algorithmic framework that takes two measurement derived datasets: raw Hi-C and partial short-range haplotypes, and constructs the full-genome haplo-type as well as phased diploid Hi-C maps. By analyzing both data sets together we thus bridge important gaps in both technologiesâfrom short to long haplotypes and from un-phased to phased Hi-C. We demonstrate that our method can recover ground truth haplotypes with high accuracy, using measured biological data as well as simulated data. We analyze the impact of noise, Hi-C sequencing depth and measured haplotype lengths on performance. Finally, we use the inferred 3D structure of a human genome to point at transcription factor targets nuclear co-localization.
