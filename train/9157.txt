We present a novel R package named synbreed to derive genome-based predictions from high-throughput genotyping and large-scale phenotyping data. The package contains a comprehensive collection of functions required to fit and cross-validate genomic prediction models. All functions are embedded within the framework of a single, unified data object. Thereby a versatile genomic prediction analysis pipeline covering data processing, visualization and analysis is established within one software package. The implementation is flexible with respect to a wide range of data formats and models. The package fills an existing gap in the availability of user-friendly software for next-generation genetics research and education. Availability: synbreed is open-source and available through CRAN http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/synbreed. The latest development version is available from R-Forge. The package synbreed is released with a vignette, a manual and three large-scale example datasets (from package synbreedData).
