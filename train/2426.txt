Classifies genes by their functions, using published scientific experimental evidence and evolutionary relationships to predict function even in the absence of direct experimental evidence. Proteins are classified by expert biologists into families and subfamilies of shared function, which are then categorized by molecular function and biological process ontology terms. PANTHER includes "PANTHER Genes" (genes, transcripts and proteins in Human, Mouse, Rat, and Drosophila melanogaster), PANTHER Families (Protein families and subfamilies and associated data such as phylogenetic trees, multiple sequence alignments and HMMs), "PANTHER Pathways" (expert-curated signaling and metabolic pathways mapped to protein sequences in PANTHER Library) and "PANTHER Ontologies".
