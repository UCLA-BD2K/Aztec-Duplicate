SPIN deals with the processing for a number of MRI sequences such as: SWI, PWI, MR angiography (MRA), dynamic contrast enhanced imaging (DCE), special image processing features such as interpolation and other mathematical operations, and special features for ease of use by clinicians. Specifically, the SWI module in SPIN makes it possible to combine magnitude and phase images and create minimum intensity maps over an arbitrary range of the tissue of interest. We also have new features (over and above what is offered in the Siemens SWI product for the 3T TRIO) for performing anti-aliasing and special processing of high pass filtered phase images. The MRA module offers a region growing algorithm to find the vessel tree starting from a specific vessel, and has the ability to simulate vessel flow. The PWI module provides cerebral blood volume (CBV), first moment mean transit time (fMTT), cerebral blood flow (CBF), bolus arriving time BAT), full-width half maximum estimates of MTT, time-to peak (TTP) and peak change in signal (PCS) images. All these maps are available in color coded images. The DCE module generates IAUC and CIAUC plots directly to a Microsoft Excel chart. SPIN also includes basic algorithms in imaging processing, such as subtraction, superimpositon, pixel division, averaging, offset shifting, edge detection, erosion, dilation, 2D parabolic fitting, sliding window filtering, complex thresholding, chirp-z transform dilation, and partial Fourier Transform processing.
