Endeavour is a tool that detects the most promising genes within large lists of candidates with respect to a biological process of interest and by combining several genomic data sources. We have benchmarked Endeavour using 450 pathway maps and 826 disease marker sets from MetaCore TM of GeneGo, Inc. containing a total of 9911 and 12 432 genes, respectively. We obtained an area under the receiver operating characteristic curves of 0.97 for pathway and of 0.91 for disease gene sets. These results indicate that Endeavour can be used to efficiently prioritize candidate genes for pathways and diseases.
