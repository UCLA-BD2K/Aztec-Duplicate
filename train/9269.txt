ANGES is a suite of Python programs that allows reconstructing ancestral genome maps from the comparison of the organization of extant-related genomes. ANGES can reconstruct ancestral genome maps for multichromosomal linear genomes and unichromo-somal circular genomes. It implements methods inspired from techniques developed to compute physical maps of extant genomes. Examples of cereal, amniote, yeast or bacteria ancestral genomes are provided, computed with ANGES. Availability: ANGES is freely available for download at http://paleoge nomics.irmacs.sfu.ca/ANGES/. Documentation and examples are available together with the package.
