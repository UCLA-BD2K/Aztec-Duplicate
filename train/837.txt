We provide intuitive maps to visualize the association between genetic elements, with emphasis on epigenetics. The approach is based on Multi-Dimensional Scaling. We provide several sensible distance metrics, and adjustment procedures to remove systematic biases typically observed when merging data obtained under different technologies or genetic backgrounds.
