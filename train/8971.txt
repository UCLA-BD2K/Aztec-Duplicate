With the advances of RNA sequencing technologies, scientists need new tools to analyze transcriptome data. We introduce RNAseqViewer, a new visualization tool dedicated to RNA-Seq data. The program offers innovative ways to represent transcriptome data for single or multiple samples. It is a handy tool for scientists who use RNA-Seq data to compare multiple transcriptomes, for example, to compare gene expression and alternative splicing of cancer samples or of different development stages.
