This package provides functions for the integrated analysis of protein-protein interaction networks and the detection of functional modules. Different datasets can be integrated into the network by assigning p-values of statistical tests to the nodes of the network. E.g. p-values obtained from the differential expression of the genes from an Affymetrix array are assigned to the nodes of the network. By fitting a beta-uniform mixture model and calculating scores from the p-values, overall scores of network regions can be calculated and an integer linear programming algorithm identifies the maximum scoring subnetwork.
