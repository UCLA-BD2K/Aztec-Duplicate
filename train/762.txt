Authority: cnio.es  -  SLR (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/goldman/SLR/) is a program to detect sites in coding DNA that are unusually conserved and/or unusually variable (that is, evolving under purify or positive selection) by analysing the pattern of changes for an alignment of sequences on an evolutionary tree. It is developed by 'Goldman Group' (EMBL - European Bioinformatics Institute).
