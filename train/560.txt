Nanopore sequencing may be the next disruptive technology in genomics, owing to its ability to detect single DNA molecules without prior amplification, lack of reliance on expensive optical components, and the ability to sequence long fragments. The MinIONâ¢ from Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) is the first nanopore sequencer to be commercialized and is now available to early-access users. The MinIONâ¢ is a USB-connected, portable nanopore sequencer that permits real-time analysis of streaming event data. Currently, the research community lacks a standardized toolkit for the analysis of nanopore datasets.
                We introduce poretools, a flexible toolkit for exploring datasets generated by nanopore sequencing devices from MinIONâ¢ for the purposes of quality control and downstream analysis. Poretools operates directly on the native FAST5 (an application of the HDF5 standard) file format produced by ONT and provides a wealth of format conversion utilities and data exploration and visualization tools.
                Poretools is an open-source software and is written in Python as both a suite of command line utilities and a Python application programming interface. Source code is freely available in Github at https://www.github.com/arq5x/poretools.
