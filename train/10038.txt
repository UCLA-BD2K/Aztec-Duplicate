While many experimentally characterized phosphorylation sites exist for certain organisms, such as human, rat and mouse, few sites are known for other organisms, hampering related research efforts. We have developed a software pipeline called DAPPLE that automates the process of using known phosphorylation sites from other organisms to identify putative sites in an organism of interest. Availability: DAPPLE is available as a web server at http://saphire.
