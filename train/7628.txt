INstruct is a database of high-quality, 3D, structurally resolved protein interactome networks in human and six model organisms. INstruct combines the scale of available high-quality binary protein interaction data with the specificity of atomic-resolution structural information derived from co-crystal evidence using a tested interaction interface inference method. Its web interface is designed to allow for flexible search based on standard and organism-specific protein and gene-naming conventions, visualization of protein architecture highlighting interaction interfaces and viewing and downloading custom 3D structurally resolved interactome datasets. Availability: INstruct is freely available on the web at http://instruct. yulab.org with all major browsers supported.
