Motivation: Modern sequencing instruments are able to generate at least hundreds of millions short reads of genomic data. Those huge volumes of data require effective means to store them, provide quick access to any record and enable fast decompression. Results: We present a specialized compression algorithm for genomic data in FASTQ format which dominates its competitor, G-SQZ, as is shown on a number of datasets from the 1000 Genomes Project (www.1000genomes.org).
