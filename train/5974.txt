pwOmics performs pathway-based level-specific data comparison of matching omics data sets based on pre-analysed user-specified lists of differential genes/transcripts and proteins. A separate downstream analysis of proteomic data including pathway identification and enrichment analysis, transcription factor identification and target gene identification is opposed to the upstream analysis starting with gene or transcript information as basis for identification of upstream transcription factors and regulators. The cross-platform comparative analysis allows for comprehensive analysis of single time point experiments and time-series experiments by providing static and dynamic analysis tools for data integration.
