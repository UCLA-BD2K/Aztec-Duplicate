Summary: We present rCGH, a comprehensive array-based comparative genomic hybridization analysis workflow, integrating computational improvements and functionalities specifically designed for precision medicine. rCGH supports the major microarray platforms, ensures a full traceability and facilitates profiles interpretation and decision-making through sharable interactive visualizations.
        Availability and implementation: The rCGH R package is available on bioconductor (under Artistic-2.0). The aCGH-viewer is available at https://fredcommo.shinyapps.io/aCGH_viewer, and the application implementation is freely available for installation at https://github.com/fredcommo/aCGH_viewer.
