RSVSim is a tool for the simulation of deletions, insertions, inversions, tandem duplications and translocations of various sizes in any genome available as FASTA-file or data package in R. The structural variations can be generated randomly, based on user-supplied genomic coordinates or associated to various kinds of repeats. The package further comprises functions to estimate the distribution of structural variation sizes from real datasets. Availability: RSVSim is implemented in R and available at http://www. bioconductor.org. A vignette with detailed descriptions of the functions and examples is included.
