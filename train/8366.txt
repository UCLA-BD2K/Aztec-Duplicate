Motivation: The Prokaryotic-genome Analysis Tool (PGAT) is a web-based database application for comparing gene content and sequence across multiple microbial genomes facilitating the discovery of genetic differences that may explain observed phenotypes. PGAT supports database queries to identify genes that are present or absent in user-selected genomes, comparison of sequence polymorphisms in sets of orthologous genes, multigenome display of regions surrounding a query gene, comparison of the distribution of genes in metabolic pathways and manual community annotation. Availability and Implementation: The PGAT website may be accessed at http://nwrce.org/pgat.
