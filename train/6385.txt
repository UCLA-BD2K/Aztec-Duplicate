Somatic internal tandem duplications (ITDs) are known to play important roles in cancer pathogenesis. Although recent advances in high-throughput sequencing technologies have enabled genome-wide detection of various types of genomic mutations, including single nucleotide variants, indels and structural variations, only a few studies have focused on ITDs. We have developed an analytical tool called 'Genomon ITDetector' for genome-wide detection of som-atic ITDs. After evaluating the sensitivity and precision of the proposed approach using synthetic data, we have demonstrated that it can successfully detect not only common ITDs involving FLT3, but also a number of ITDs affecting other putative driver genes in acute myeloid leukemia exome sequencing data.
