Knowledge of pathogenâhost protein interactions is required to better understand infection mechanisms. The pathogenâ host interaction search tool (PHISTO) is a web-accessible platform that provides relevant information about pathogenâhost interactions (PHIs). It enables access to the most up-to-date PHI data for all pathogen types for which experimentally verified protein interactions with human are available. The platform also offers integrated tools for visu-alization of PHI networks, graphâtheoretical analysis of targeted human proteins, BLAST search and text mining for detecting missing experimental methods. PHISTO will facilitate PHI studies that provide potential therapeutic targets for infectious diseases.
