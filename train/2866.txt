This toolbox can be used to estimate the hemodynamic response function using:

SPMs canonical HRF
Canonical HRF + temporal derivative
Canonical HRF + temporal derivative + dispersion derivative
Finite Impulse Response (FIR) model
Smooth FIR model
Inverse logit model

It also contains a diagnostic component which checks the residuals for model misspecification.
