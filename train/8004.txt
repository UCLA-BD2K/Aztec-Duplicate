Motivation: Quantitative and qualitative assessment of biological data often produces small essential recurrent networks, containing 3â5 components called network motifs. In this context, model solutions for small network motifs represent very high interest. Results: Software package NetExplore has been created in order to generate, classify and analyze solutions for network motifs including up to six network components. NetExplore allows plotting and visualization of the solution's phase spaces and bifurcation diagrams. Availability and implementation: The current version of NetExplore has been implemented in Perl-CGI and is accessible at the following locations: http://line.bioinfolab.net/nex/NetExplore.htm and
