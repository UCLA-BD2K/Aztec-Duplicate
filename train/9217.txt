Tomo3D implements a multithreaded vectorized approach to tomographic reconstruction that takes full advantage of the computer power in modern multicore computers. Full resolution tomograms are generated at high speed on standard computers with no special system requirements. Tomo3D has the most common reconstruction methods implemented, namely weighted Back-projection (WBP) and simultaneous iterative reconstruction technique (SIRT). It proves to be competitive with current graphic processor unit solutions in terms of processing time, in the order of a few seconds with WBP or minutes with SIRT. The program is compatible with standard packages, which easily allows integration in the electron tomography workflow.
