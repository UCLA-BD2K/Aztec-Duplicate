Motivation: Statistical validation of protein identifications is an important issue in shotgun proteomics. The false discovery rate (FDR) is a powerful statistical tool for evaluating the protein identification result. Several research efforts have been made for FDR estimation at the protein level. However, there are still certain drawbacks in the existing FDR estimation methods based on the target-decoy strategy. Results: In this article, we propose a decoy-free protein-level FDR estimation method. Under the null hypothesis that each candidate protein matches an identified peptide totally at random, we assign statistical significance to protein identifications in terms of the permutation P-value and use these P-values to calculate the FDR. Our method consists of three key steps: (i) generating random bipartite graphs with the same structure; (ii) calculating the protein scores on these random graphs; and (iii) calculating the permutation P value and final FDR. As it is time-consuming or prohibitive to execute the protein inference algorithms for thousands of times in step ii, we first train a linear regression model using the original bipartite graph and identification scores provided by the target inference algorithm. Then we use the learned regression model as a substitute of original protein inference method to predict protein scores on shuffled graphs. We test our method on six public available datasets. The results show that our method is comparable with those state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of estimation accuracy.
