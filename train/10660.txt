We propose a parametric model, HiCNorm, to remove systematic biases in the raw Hi-C contact maps, resulting in a simple, fast, yet accurate normalization procedure. Compared with the existing Hi-C normalization method developed by Yaffe and Tanay, HiCNorm has fewer parameters, runs 41000 times faster and achieves higher reproducibility.
