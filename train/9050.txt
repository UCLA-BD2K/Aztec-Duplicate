Motivation: Some economically important plants including wheat and cotton have more than two copies of each chromosome. With the decreasing cost and increasing read length of next-generation sequencing technologies, reconstructing the multiple haplotypes of a polyploid genome from its sequence reads becomes practical. However, the computational challenge in polyploid haplotyping is much greater than that in diploid haplotyping, and there are few related methods. Results: This paper models the polyploid haplotyping problem as an optimal poly-partition problem of the reads, called the Polyploid Balanced Optimal Partition (PBOP) model. For the reads sequenced from a k-ploid genome, the model tries to divide the reads into k groups such that the difference between the reads of the same group is minimized while the difference between the reads of different groups is maximized. When the genotype information is available, the model is extended to the Polyploid Balanced Optimal Partition with Genotype constraint (PBOPG) problem. These models are all NP-hard. We propose two heuristic algorithms, H-PoP and H-PoPG, based on dynamic programming and a strategy of limiting the number of intermediate solutions at each iteration, to solve the two models, respectively. Extensive experimental results on simulated and real data show that our algorithms can solve the models effectively, and are much faster and more accurate than the recent state-of-the-art polyploid haplotyping algorithms. The experiments also show that our algorithms can deal with long reads and deep read coverage effectively and accurately. Furthermore, H-PoP might be applied to help determine the ploidy of an organism. Availability: https://github.com/MinzhuXie/H-PoPG Contact:
