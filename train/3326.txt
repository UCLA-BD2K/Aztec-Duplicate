This tool is designed to provide legal and ethical requirements for making data from different existing data sources for new contexts available. It assumes the perspective of a legal entity (bridge provider) who wants to link data from different sources (data provider) for making them available to the researcher (bridge user). This bridge-provider gets requirements for each data provider separately and has legal relationships to the data providers as well as to the bridge-users.
