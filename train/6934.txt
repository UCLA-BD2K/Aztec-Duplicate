Despite the importance of using the semantic distance to improve the performance of conventional expression-based clustering, there are few freely available software that provides a clustering algorithm using the ontology-based semantic distances as prior knowledge. Here, we present the SICAGO (SemI-supervised Cluster Analysis using semantic distance between gene pairs in Gene Ontology) system that helps to discover the groups of genes more effectively using prior knowledge extracted from Gene Ontology.
