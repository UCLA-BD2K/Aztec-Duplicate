Motivation: Oxford Nanopore's MinION device has matured rapidly and is now capable of producing over one million reads and several gigabases of sequence data per run. The nature of the MinION output requires new tools that are easy to use by scientists with a range of computational skills and which enable quick and simple QC and data extraction from MinION runs. Results: We have developed two GUIs for the R package poRe that allow parallel and real-time processing of MinION datasets. Both GUIs are capable of extracting sequence-and meta-data from large MinION datasets via a friendly point-and-click interface using commodity hardware. Availability and Implementation: The GUIs are packaged within poRe which is available on SourceForge: https://sourceforge.net/projects/rpore/files/.
