ChargeCalculator is a complex yet intuitive utility for the calculation of atomic charges for small drug-like molecules, as well as for large biomolecular complexes. Up to thousands molecules can be processed in one run. Empirical atomic charges that respond to changes in molecular conformation are calculated via an efficient implementation of the well established Electronegativity Equalization Method (EEM). ChargeCalculator allows to use any of the EEM parameters sets published in literature, provided that appropriate parameters are available for all atom types found in the molecules submitted. You may then download your results, or analyze them directly in the web browser.
