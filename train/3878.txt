PLATO (Plugin for Autocomplete on Ontologies) is a general-use embeddable JavaScript widget used for browsing and searching ontologies. It is generically configurable for use with any ontology served by the Ontology Lookup Service (OLS). PLATOâs features include the ability to visualise matching ontology terms in their rightful place in the tree, and to expand and collapse nodes as desired.
