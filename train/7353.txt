Motivation: Gene enrichment is a requisite for the interpretation of biological complexity related to specific molecular pathways and biological processes. Furthermore, when interpreting NGS data and human variations, including those related to pathologies, gene enrichment allows the inclusion of other genes that in the human interactome space may also play important key roles in the emergency of the phenotype. Here, we describe NET-GE, a web server for associating biological processes and pathways to sets of human proteins involved in the same phenotype Results: NET-GE is based on proteinâprotein interaction networks, following the notion that for a set of proteins, the context of their specific interactions can better define their function and the processes they can be related to in the biological complexity of the cell. Our method is suited to extract statistically validated enriched terms from Gene Ontology, KEGG and REACTOME annotation databases. Furthermore, NET-GE is effective even when the number of input proteins is small. Availability and Implementation: NET-GE web server is publicly available and accessible at http:// net-ge.biocomp.unibo.it/enrich.
