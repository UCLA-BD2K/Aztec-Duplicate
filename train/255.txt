Summary: Here, we present riboPicker, a robust framework for the rapid, automated identification and removal of ribosomal RNA sequences from metatranscriptomic datasets. The results can be exported for subsequent analysis, and the databases used for the web-based version are updated on a regular basis. riboPicker categorizes rRNA-like sequences and provides graphical visualizations and tabular outputs of ribosomal coverage, alignment results and taxonomic classifications.
        Availability and implementation: This open-source application was implemented in Perl and can be used as stand-alone version or accessed online through a user-friendly web interface. The source code, user help and additional information is available at http://ribopicker.sourceforge.net/.
