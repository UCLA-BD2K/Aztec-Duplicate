Tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS or MS n) is a potent technique for characterizing N-glycan structures. GlycanAnalysis searches a glycan database to support the identification of glycan structures from MS/MS spectra. It also calculates diagnostic ions of glycan structures registered in a glycan database (GlycomeDB or KEGG GLYCAN) and searches for MS/MS spectra of N-glycans that match diagnostic ions to determine the structures. This program functions as a plug-in for MassÃ¾Ã¾, a freeware mass spectrum visualization and analysis program. Availability and implementation: The executable files of MassÃ¾Ã¾ are available for free at http:// www.first-ms3d.jp/english/. The GlycanAnalysis plug-in is included in the standard package of MassÃ¾Ã¾ for Windows. Contact
