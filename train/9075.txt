Motivation: Methods for detecting positive selection relied on finding evidence of long haplotypes to identify candidate regions under selection. However, these methods generally do not identify the length and form of the selected haplotype. Results: We present HapFinder, a method which can find the common longest haplotype under three different settings from a database, which is relevant in the analysis of positive selection in population genetics and also in medical genetics for finding the likely haplotype form carrying the causal allele at the functional polymorphism. Availability: A java program, implementing the methods described in HapFinder, together with R scripts and datasets for producing the figures presented in this article are publicly available at
