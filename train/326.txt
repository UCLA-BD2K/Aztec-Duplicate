Summary: Visualizing and summarizing data from genomic studies continues to be a challenge. Here, we introduce the GenVisR package to addresses this challenge by providing highly customizable, publication-quality graphics focused on cohort level genome analyses. GenVisR provides a rapid and easy-to-use suite of genomic visualization tools, while maintaining a high degree of flexibility by leveraging the abilities of ggplot2 and Bioconductor.
        Availability and Implementation: GenVisR is an R package available via Bioconductor (https://bioconductor.org/packages/GenVisR) under GPLv3. Support is available via GitHub (https://github.com/griffithlab/GenVisR/issues) and the Bioconductor support website.
