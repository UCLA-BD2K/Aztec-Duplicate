Drugster is a fully interactive pipeline designed to break the command line barrier and introduce a new user-friendly environment to perform drug design, lead and structure optimization experiments through an efficient combination of the PDB2PQR, Ligbuilder, Gromacs and Dock suites. Our platform features a novel workflow that guides the user through each logical step of the iterative 3D structural optimization setup and drug design process, by providing a seamless interface to all incorporated packages. Availability: Drugster can be freely downloaded via our dedicated server system at http://www.bioacademy.gr/bioinformatics/drugster/. Contact: dvlachakis@bioacademy.gr.
