fconv is a program intended for parsing and manipulating multiple aspects and properties of molecular data. Up to now, it has been developed and extensively tested for 3 years. It has become a very robust and comprehensive tool involved in a broad range of computational workflows that are currently applied in our drug design environment. Typical tasks are as follows: conversion and error correction of formats such as PDB(QT), MOL2, SDF, DLG and CIF; extracting ligands from PDB as MOL2; automatic or ligand-based cavity detection; rmsd calculation and clustering; substructure searches; alignment and structural superposition; building of crystal packings; adding hydrogens; calculation of various properties like the number of rotatable bonds; molecular weights or vdW volumes. The atom type classification is based on a consistent assignment of internal atom types, which are by far more differentiated compared with e.g. Sybyl atom types. Apart from the predefined mapping of these types onto Sybyl types, the user is able to assign own mappings by providing modified template files, thus allowing for tailor-made atom type sets.
