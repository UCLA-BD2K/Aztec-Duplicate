The CANlab Core Tools package is a set of Matlab functions that are designed to serve miscellaneous purposes. Many of them have stand-alone command line function, but the toolbox also contains functions that are used in other CANlab toolboxes, and so this package should be downloaded and put on the Matlab path when using any of the toolboxes.
