DSK is a k-mer counting software, similar to Jellyfish. Jellyfish is very fast but limited to large-memory servers and k Ã¢â°Â¤ 32. In contrast, DSK supports large values of k, and runs with (almost-)arbitrarily low memory usage and reasonably low temporary disk usage. DSK can count k-mers of large Illumina datasets on laptops and desktop computers.
