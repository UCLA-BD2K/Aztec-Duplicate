Motivation: Clustering methods including k-means, SOM, UPGMA, DAA, CLICK, GENECLUSTER, CAST, DHC, PMETIS and KMETIS have been widely used in biological studies for gene expression, protein localization, sequence recognition and more. All these clustering methods have some benefits and drawbacks. We propose a novel graph-based clustering software called COMUSA for combining the benefits of a collection of clusterings into a final clustering having better overall quality. Results: COMUSA implementation is compared with PMETIS, KMETIS and k-means. Experimental results on artificial, real and biological datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. COMUSA produces very good quality clusters in a short amount of time.
