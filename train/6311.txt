Here we introduce ccSOL omics, a webserver for large-scale calculations of protein solubility. Our method allows (i) prote-ome-wide predictions; (ii) identification of soluble fragments within each sequences; (iii) exhaustive single-point mutation analysis. Results: Using coil/disorder, hydrophobicity, hydrophilicity,-sheet and-helix propensities, we built a predictor of protein solubility. Our approach shows an accuracy of 79% on the training set (36 990 Target Track entries). Validation on three independent sets indicates that ccSOL omics discriminates soluble and insoluble proteins with an accuracy of 74% on 31 760 proteins sharing 530% sequence similarity. Availability and implementation: ccSOL omics can be freely ac-cessed on the web at
