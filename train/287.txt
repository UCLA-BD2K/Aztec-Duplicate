Motivations: Spreadsheet-like tabular formats are ever more popular in the biomedical field as a mean for experimental reporting. The problem of converting the graph of an experimental workflow into a table-based representation occurs in many such formats and is not easy to solve.
        Results: We describe graph2tab, a library that implements methods to realise such a conversion in a size-optimised way. Our solution is generic and can be adapted to specific cases of data exporters or data converters that need to be implemented.
        Availability and Implementation: The library source code and documentation are available at http://github.com/ISA-tools/graph2tab.

        Supplementary Information: A supplementary document describes the theoretical and technical details about the library implementation.
