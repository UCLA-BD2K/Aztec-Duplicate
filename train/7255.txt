Dynamics governing the function of biomolecule is usually described as exchange processes and can be monitored at atomic resolution with nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) relaxation dispersion data. Here, we present a new tool for the analysis of CPMG relaxation dispersion profiles (ShereKhan). The web interface to ShereKhan provides a user-friendly environment for the analysis. Availability: A stable version of ShereKhan, the web application and documentation are available at http://sherekhan.
