SurvJamda (Survival prediction by joint analysis of microarray data) is an R package that utilizes joint analysis of microarray gene expression data to predict patients' survival and risk assessment. Joint analysis can be performed by merging datasets or meta-analysis to increase the sample size and to improve survival prognosis. The prognosis performance derived from the combined datasets can be assessed to determine which feature selection approach, joint analysis method and bias estimation provide the most robust prognosis for a given set of datasets. Availability: The survJamda package is available at the Comprehensive R Archive Network, http://cran.r
