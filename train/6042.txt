The Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH) Genomics API allows the interoperable exchange of genomic information across multiple organizations and on multiple platforms. This is a freely available open standard for interoperability, that uses common web protocols to support serving and sharing of data on DNA sequences and genomic variation. The API is implemented as a webservice to create a data source which may be integrated into visualization software, web-based genomics portals or processed as part of genomic analysis pipelines. It overcomes the barriers of incompatible infrastructure between organizations and institutions to enable DNA data providers and consumers to better share genomic data and work together on a global scale, advancing genome research and clinical application.
