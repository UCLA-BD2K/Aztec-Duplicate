Motivation: The experimental difficulties of alpha-helical transmembrane protein structure determination make this class of protein an important target for sequence-based structure prediction tools. The MEMPACK prediction server allows users to submit a transmembrane protein sequence and returns transmembrane topology, lipid exposure, residue contacts, helixâ€“helix interactions and helical packing arrangement predictions in both plain text and graphical formats using a number of novel machine learning-based algorithms. Availability: The server can be accessed as a new component of the PSIPRED portal by at
