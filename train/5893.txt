"BrainSuite13 is a collection of image analysis tools designed to process magnetic resonance images (MRI) of the human brain. BrainSuite13 provides an automatic sequence to extract cortical surface mesh models from the MRI, tools to register these to a labeled atlas to define anatomical regions of interest, and tools for processing diffusion imaging data including coregistration to anatomical data, ODF and tensor fitting and tractography. BrainSuite13 also contains visualization tools for exploring these data, and can produce interactive maps of regional connectivity."
