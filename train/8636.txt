MesoRD is a tool for simulating stochastic reaction-diffusion systems as modeled by the reaction diffusion master equation. The simulated systems are defined in the Systems Biology Markup Language with additions to define compartment geometries. MesoRD 1.0 supports scale-dependent reaction rate constants and reactions between reactants in neighbouring subvolumes. These new features make it possible to construct physically consistent models of diffusion-controlled reactions also at fine spatial discretization.
