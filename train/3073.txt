Rcade (which stands for "R-based analysis of ChIP-seq And Differential Expression") is a tool for integrating ChIP-seq data with differential expression summary data, through a Bayesian framework. A key application is in identifing the genes targeted by a transcription factor of interest - that is, we collect genes that are associated with a ChIP-seq peak, and differential expression under some perturbation related to that TF.
