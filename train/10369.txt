Motivation: For many classes of disease the same genetic risk variants underly many related phenotypes or disease subtypes. Multinomial logistic regression provides an attractive framework to analyze multi-category phenotypes, and explore the genetic relationships between these phenotype categories. We introduce Trinculo, a program that implements a wide range of multinomial analyses in a single fast package that is designed to be easy to use by users of standard genome-wide association study software. Availability and implementation: An open source C implementation, with code and binaries for Linux and Mac OSX, is available for download at http://sourceforge.net/projects/trinculo
