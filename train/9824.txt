Mixed model-based approaches to genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of binary traits in related individuals can account for non-genetic risk factors in an integrated manner. However, they are technically challenging. GLOGS (Genome-wide LOGistic mixed model/Score test) addresses such challenges with efficient statistical procedures and a parallel implementation. GLOGS has high power relative to alternative approaches as risk covariate effects increase, and can complete a GWAS in minutes. Availability: Source code and documentation are provided at
