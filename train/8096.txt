Pattern Gene Finder (PaGeFinder) is a web-based server for on-line detection of gene expression patterns from serial transcriptomic data generated by high-throughput technologies like microarray or next-generation sequencing. Three particular parameters, the specificity measure, the dispersion measure and the contribution measure, were introduced and implemented in PaGeFinder to help quantitative and interactive identification of pattern genes like housekeeping genes, specific (selective) genes and repressed genes. Besides the on-line computation service, the PaGeFinder also provides downloadable Java programs for local detection of gene expression patterns.
