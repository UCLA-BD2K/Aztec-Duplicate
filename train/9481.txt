Motivation: Protein residueâresidue contacts continue to play a larger and larger role in protein tertiary structure modeling and evaluation. Yet, while the importance of contact information increases, the performance of sequence-based contact predictors has improved slowly. New approaches and methods are needed to spur further development and progress in the field. Results: Here we present DNCON, a new sequence-based residueâ residue contact predictor using deep networks and boosting techniques. Making use of graphical processing units and CUDA parallel computing technology, we are able to train large boosted ensembles of residueâresidue contact predictors achieving state-of-the-art performance. Availability: The web server of the prediction method (DNCON) is
