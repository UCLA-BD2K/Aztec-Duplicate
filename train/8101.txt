The miRror application provides insights on microRNA (miRNA) regulation. It is based on the notion of a combinatorial regulation by an ensemble of miRNAs or genes. miRror integrates predictions from a dozen of miRNA resources that are based on complementary algorithms into a unified statistical framework. For miRNAs set as input, the online tool provides a ranked list of targets, based on set of resources selected by the user, according to their significance of being coordinately regulated. Symmetrically, a set of genes can be used as input to suggest a set of miRNAs. The user can restrict the analysis for the preferred tissue or cell line. miRror is suitable for analyzing results from miRNAs profiling, proteomics and gene expression arrays.
