RPPanalyzer is a statistical tool developed to read reverse-phase protein array data, to perform the basic data analysis and to visualize the resulting biological information. The R-package provides different functions to compare protein expression levels of different samples and to normalize the data. Implemented plotting functions permit a quality control by monitoring data distribution and signal validity. Finally, the data can be visualized in heatmaps, boxplots, time course plots and correlation plots. RPPanalyzer is a flexible tool and tolerates a huge variety of different experimental designs. Availability: The RPPAanalyzer is open source and freely available as an R-Package on the CRAN platform http://cran.r-project.org/
