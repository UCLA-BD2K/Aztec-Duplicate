Motivation: Understanding exact structure of an individual's haplo-type plays a significant role in various fields of human genetics. Despite tremendous research effort in recent years, fast and accurate haplotype reconstruction remains as an active research topic, mainly owing to the computational challenges involved. Existing haplotype assembly algorithms focus primarily on improving accuracy of the assembly, making them computationally challenging for applications on large high-throughput sequence data. Therefore, there is a need to develop haplotype reconstruction algorithms that are not only accurate but also highly scalable. Results: In this article, we introduce FastHap, a fast and accurate haplotype reconstruction approach, which is up to one order of magnitude faster than the state-of-the-art haplotype inference algorithms while also delivering higher accuracy than these algorithms. FastHap leverages a new similarity metric that allows us to precisely measure distances between pairs of fragments. The distance is then used in building the fuzzy conflict graphs of fragments. Given that optimal haplotype reconstruction based on minimum error correction is known to be NP-hard, we use our fuzzy conflict graphs to develop a fast heuristic for fragment partitioning and haplotype reconstruction.
