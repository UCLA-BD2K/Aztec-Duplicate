We here present BioCircos.js, an interactive and lightweight JavaScript library especially for biological data interactive visualization. BioCircos.js facilitates the development of web-based applications for circular visualization of various biological data, such as genomic features, genetic variations, gene expression and biomolecular interactions. Availability and implementation: BioCircos.js and its manual are freely available online at http://bio info.ibp.ac.cn/biocircos/.
