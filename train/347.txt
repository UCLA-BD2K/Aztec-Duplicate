Summary: Drug versus Disease (DvD) provides a pipeline, available through R
or Cytoscape, for the comparison of drug and disease gene expression profiles from public
microarray repositories. Negatively correlated profiles can be used to generate hypotheses
of drug-repurposing, whereas positively correlated profiles may be used to infer side
effects of drugs. DvD allows users to compare drug and disease signatures with dynamic
access to databases Array Express, Gene Expression Omnibus and data from the Connectivity
Map.
        Availability and implementation: R package (submitted to Bioconductor) under
GPL 3 and Cytoscape plug-in freely available for download at www.ebi.ac.uk/saezrodriguez/DVD/.
