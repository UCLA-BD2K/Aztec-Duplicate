ProtVista is a comprehensive visualization tool for the graphical representation of protein sequence features in the UniProt Knowledgebase, experimental proteomics and variation public data-sets. The complexity and relationships in this wealth of data pose a challenge in interpretation. Integrative visualization approaches such as provided by ProtVista are thus essential for researchers to understand the data and, for instance, discover patterns affecting function and disease associations. Availability and Implementation: ProtVista is a JavaScript component released as an open source project under the Apache 2 License.
