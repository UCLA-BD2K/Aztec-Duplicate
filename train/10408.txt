Motivation: Computational modeling of proteinâDNA complexes remains a challenging problem in structural bioinformatics. One of the key factors for a successful proteinâDNA docking is a potential function that can accurately discriminate the near-native structures from decoy complexes and at the same time make conformational sampling more efficient. Here, we developed a novel orientation-dependent, knowledge-based, residue-level potential for improving transcription factor (TF)-DNA docking. Results: We demonstrated the performance of this new potential in TFâDNA binding affinity prediction, discrimination of native proteinâ DNA complex from decoy structures, and most importantly in rigid TFâDNA docking. The rigid TFâDNA docking with the new orientation potential, on a benchmark of 38 complexes, successfully predicts 42% of the cases with root mean square deviations lower than 1 A Ë and 55% of the cases with root mean square deviations lower than 3 A Ë. The results suggest that docking with this new orientation-dependent, coarse-grained statistical potential can achieve high-docking accuracy and can serve as a crucial first step in multi-stage flexible proteinâDNA docking.
