We have implemented a high-performance computing (HPC) version of ProtTest that can be executed in parallel in multicore desktops and clusters. This version, called ProtTest 3, includes new features and extended capabilities. Availability: ProtTest 3 source code and binaries are freely available under GNU license for download from http://darwin.uvigo.es/ software/prottest3, linked to a Mercurial repository at Bitbucket (https://bitbucket.org/).
