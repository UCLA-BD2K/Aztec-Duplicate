DNA replication, a central event for cell proliferation, is the basis of biological inheritance. The identification of replication origins helps to reveal the mechanism of the regulation of DNA replication. However, only few eukaryotic replication origins were characterized not long ago; nevertheless, recent genome-wide approaches have boosted the number of mapped replication origins. To gain a comprehensive understanding of the nature of eukaryotic replication origins, we have constructed a Database of Eukaryotic ORIs (DeOri), which contains all the eukaryotic ones identified by genome-wide analyses currently available. A total of 16 145 eukaryotic replication origins have been collected from 6 eukaryotic organisms in which genome-wide studies have been performed, the replication-origin numbers being 433, 7489, 1543, 148, 348 and 6184 for humans, mice, Arabidopsis thaliana, Kluyveromyces lactis, Schizosaccharomyces pombe and Drosophila melanogaster, respectively.
