Slice4 extension for the Swiss Skull Stripper. The algorithm registers a grayscale atlas image to the graysacle patient data. The associated atlas brain mask is propagated to the patient data using the registration transformation. This brain mask is eroded and serves as initialization for a refined brain extraction based on level-sets. The level-set towards the edge of the brain-skull border with dedicated expansion, curvature and advection terms.
