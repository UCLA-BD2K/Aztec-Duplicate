The idea behind the genetic algorithm is that it is an efficient way to search through a large and complicated space.  In this case, the complicated space is the space of possible fMRI designs.  In order to use a GA, you have to 1) be able to parameterize a design as a list of numbers, and 2) evaluate the fitness of a design using some kind of metric testable in computer simulation.  This set of Matlab routines will help you to run a GA to optimize experimental designs (hopefully) a little easier than if you didnât have them.  In the best case, itâs âplug and playâ â just create (or modify an example script) a script with the experiment parameters you want and run it.
