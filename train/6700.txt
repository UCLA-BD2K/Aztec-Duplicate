Motivation: Random sampling of the solution space has emerged as a popular tool to explore and infer properties of large metabolic networks. However, conventional sampling approaches commonly used do not eliminate thermodynamically unfeasible loops. Results: In order to overcome this limitation, we developed an efficient sampling algorithm called loopless Artificially Centered Hit-and-Run on a Box (ll-ACHRB). This algorithm is inspired by the Hit-and-Run on a Box algorithm for uniform sampling from general regions, but employs the directions of choice approach of Artificially Centered Hit-and-Run. A novel strategy for generating feasible warmup points improved both sampling efficiency and mixing. ll-ACHRB shows overall better performance than current strategies to generate feasible flux samples across several models. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a failure to eliminate unfeasible loops greatly affects sample statistics, in particular the correlation structure. Finally, we discuss recommendations for the interpretation of sampling results and possible algorithmic improvements.
