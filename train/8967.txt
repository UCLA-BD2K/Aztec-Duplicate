Background: The rapid progress of high-throughput DNA sequencing techniques has dramatically reduced the costs of whole genome sequencing, which leads to revolutionary advances in gene industry. The explosively increasing volume of raw data outpaces the decreasing disk cost and the storage of huge sequencing data has become a bottleneck of downstream analyses. Data compression is considered as a solution to reduce the dependency on storage. Efficient sequencing data compression methods are highly demanded.
