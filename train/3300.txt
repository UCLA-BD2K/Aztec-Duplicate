With this tool you can calculate the intersection(s) of list of elements. It will generate a textual output indicating which elements are in each intersection or are unique to a certain list. If the number of lists is lower than 6 it will also produce a graphical output in the form of a venn diagram. You have the choice between symmetric (default) or non symmetric venn diagrams. Currently you are able to calculate the intersections of at maximum 30 lists.
