HAMMER is the acronym for Hierarchical Attribute Matching Mechanism for Elastic Registration (Dinggang Shen, Christos Davatzikos, HAMMER: Hierarchical Attribute Matching Mechanism for Elastic Registration, IEEE Trans. on Medical Imaging, 21(11):1421-1439, Nov 2002), an algorithm for elastic registration of medical images using geometric moment invariants as attributes and hierarchical attribute matching mechanism for finding deformation field. We have implemented HAMMER registration algorithm under the framework of ITK, and also provided the HAMMER registration as a module for the 3DSlicer. Moreover, we have significantly improved the speed of HAMMER registration algorithm, as well as its registration accuracy in the new version of HAMMER algorithm included in the software package.
