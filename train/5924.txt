Fast functions for bipartite network rewiring through N consecutive switching steps (See References) and for the computation of the minimal number of switching steps to be performed in order to maximise the dissimilarity with respect to the original network. Includes function for the analysis of the introduced randomness across the switching and several other routines to analyse the resulting networks and their natural projections. Extension to undirected networks (not bipartite) is also provided. Starting from version 1.9.7 a more precise bound (especially for small network) has been implemented. Starting from version 2.2.0 the analysis routine is more useful and a visual montioring of the underlying Markov Chain has been implemented.
