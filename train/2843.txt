This package provides an association test that is capable of dealing with very rare and even private variants. This is accomplished by a kernel-based approach that takes the positions of the variants into account. The test can be used for pre-processed matrix data, but also directly for variant data stored in VCF files. Association testing can be performed whole-genome, whole-exome, or restricted to pre-defined regions of interest. The test is complemented by tools for analyzing and visualizing the results.
