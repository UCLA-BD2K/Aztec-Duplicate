Summary: We introduce SharpViSu, an interactive open-source software with a graphical user interface, which allows performing processing steps for localization data in an integrated manner. This includes common features and new tools such as correction of chromatic aberrations, drift correction based on iterative cross-correlation calculations, selection of localization events, reconstruction of 2D and 3D datasets in different representations, estimation of resolution by Fourier ring correlation, clustering analysis based on Voronoi diagrams and Ripleyâ€™s functions. SharpViSu is optimized to work with eventlist tables exported from most popular localization software. We show applications of these on single and double-labelled super-resolution data.
        Availability and implementation: SharpViSu is available as open source code and as compiled stand-alone application under https://github.com/andronovl/SharpViSu.
