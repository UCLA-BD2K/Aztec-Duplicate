In response to increasing amounts of sequencing data, faster and faster aligners need to become available. Here, we introduce BRAT-nova, a completely rewritten and improved implementation of the mapping tool BRAT-BW for bisulfite-treated reads (BS-Seq). BRAT-nova is very fast and accurate. On the human genome, BRAT-nova is 2–7 times faster than state-of-the-art aligners, while maintaining the same percentage of uniquely mapped reads and space usage. On synthetic reads, BRAT-nova is 2–8 times faster than state-of-the-art aligners while maintaining similar mapping accuracy, methylation call accuracy, methylation level accuracy and space efficiency. Availability and implementation: The software is available in the public domain at
