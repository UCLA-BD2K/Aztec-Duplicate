l1_ls is a simple Matlab solver for l1-regularized least squares problems described in the paper A Method for Large-Scale l1-Regularized Least Squares. l1_ls is developed for large problems. It can solve large sparse problems with a million variables with high accuracy in a few tens of minutes on a PC. It can also efficiently solve very large dense problems, that arise in sparse signal recovery with orthogonal transforms, by exploiting fast algorithms for these transforms.
