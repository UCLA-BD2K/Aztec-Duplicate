Motivation: A proper target or marker is essential in any diagnosis (e.g. an infection or cancer). An ideal diagnostic target should be both conserved in and unique to the pathogen. Currently, these targets can only be identified manually, which is time-consuming and usually error-prone. Because of the increasingly frequent occurrences of emerging epidemics and multidrug-resistant 'superbugs', a rapid diagnostic target identification process is needed. Results: A new method that can identify uniquely conserved regions (UCRs) as candidate diagnostic targets for a selected group of organisms solely from their genomic sequences has been developed and successfully tested. Using a sequence-indexing algorithm to identify UCRs and a k-mer integer-mapping model for computational efficiency , this method has successfully identified UCRs within the bacteria domain for 15 test groups, including pathogenic, probiotic, commensal and extremophilic bacterial species or strains. Based on the identified UCRs, new diagnostic primer sets were designed, and their specificity and efficiency were tested by polymerase chain reaction amplifications from both pure isolates and samples containing mixed cultures. Availability and implementation: The UCRs identified for the 15 bacterial species are now freely available at http://ucr.synblex.com.
