ODORactor is an open access web server aimed at providing a platform for identifying odorant receptors (ORs) for small molecules and for browsing existing OR-ligand pairs. It enables the prediction of ORs from the molecular structures of arbitrary chemicals by integrating two individual functionalities: odorant verification and OR recognition. The prediction of the ORs for several odorants was experimentally validated in the study. In addition, ODORactor features a comprehensive repertoire of olfactory information that has been manually curated from literature. Therefore, ODORactor may provide an effective way to decipher olfactory coding and could be a useful server tool for both basic olfaction research in academia and for odorant discovery in industry.
