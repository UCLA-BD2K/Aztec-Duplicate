isochore plots GC content in windows over a DNA sequence. The data may also be written to output file. The window wize and shift increment (the number of bases separating the start of each window) may be specified. isochore is suitable for use with large sequences such as complete chromosomes or large genomic contigs, although interesting results can also be obtained from shorter sequences.
