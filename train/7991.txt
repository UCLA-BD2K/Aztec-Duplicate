The Pegasus project encompasses a set of technologies that help workflow-based applications execute in a number of different environments including desktops, campus clusters, grids, and clouds. Pegasus bridges the scientific domain and the execution environment by automatically mapping high-level workflow descriptions onto distributed resources. It automatically locates the necessary input data and computational resources necessary for workflow execution.Pegasus enables scientists to construct workflows in abstract terms without worrying about the details of the underlying execution environment or the particulars of the low-level specifications required by the middleware (HTCondor, Globus, or Amazon EC2). Pegasus also bridges the current  cyberinfrastructure by effectively coordinating multiple distributed resources.

Pegasus has been used in a number of scientific domains including astronomy, bioinformatics, earthquake science , gravitational wave physics, ocean science, limnology, and others. When errors occur, Pegasus tries to recover when possible by retrying tasks, by retrying the entire workflow, by providing workflow-level checkpointing, by re-mapping portions of the workflow, by trying alternative data sources for staging data, and, when all else fails, by providing a rescue workflow containing a description of only the work that remains to be done. It cleans up storage as the workflow is executed so that data-intensive workflows have enough space to execute on storage-constrained resources]. Pegasus keeps track of what has been done (provenance) including the locations of data used and produced, and which software was used with which parameters.
