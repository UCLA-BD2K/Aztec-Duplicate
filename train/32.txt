Summary: The MAGE-TAB format for microarray data representation and exchange has been proposed by the microarray community to replace the more complex MAGE-ML format. We present a suite of tools to support MAGE-TAB generation and validation, conversion between existing formats for data exchange, visualization of the experiment designs encoded by MAGE-TAB documents and the mining of such documents for semantic content.
