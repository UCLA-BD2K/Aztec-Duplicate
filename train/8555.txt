MIA detects and visualizes isotopic enrichment in gas chromatography electron ioniza-tion mass spectrometry (GC–EI-MS) datasets in a non-targeted manner. It provides an easy-to-use graphical user interface that allows for visual mass isotopomer distribution analysis across multiple datasets. MIA helps to reveal changes in metabolic fluxes, visualizes metabolic proximity of isotopically enriched compounds and shows the fate of the applied stable isotope labeled tracer. Availability and Implementation: Linux and Windows binaries, documentation, and sample data are freely available for download at http://massisotopolomeanalyzer.lu. MIA is a stand-alone application implemented in C þþ and based on Qt5, NTFD and the MetaboliteDetector framework.
