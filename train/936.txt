Position Specific Iterative BLAST (PSI-BLAST) refers to a feature of NCBI BLAST 2.0 in which a position-specific scoring matrix (PSSM) profile is constructed from set of BLAST alignments. The PSSM is then used to search the database in subsequent iterations allowing the detection of distant evolutionary relationships. This can be combined with the Pattern Hit Initiated BLAST (PHI-BLAST) mode to constrain the PSSM using a ProSite pattern to define the region(s) to be used when building the PSSM.
