Scanning probe microscopy (SPM) is already a relevant tool in biological research at the nanoscale. We present 'Flatten plus', a recent and helpful implementation in the well-known WSxM free software package. 'Flatten plus' allows reducing low-frequency noise in SPM images in a semi-automated way preventing the appearance of typical artifacts associated with such filters.
