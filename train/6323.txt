Anuran tissues, and especially skin, are a rich source of bioactive peptides and their precursors. We here present a manually curated database of antimicrobial and other defense peptides with a total of 2571 entries, most of them in the precursor form with demarcated signal peptide (SP), acidic proregion(s) and bioactive moiety(s) corresponding to 1923 non-identical bioactive sequences. Search functions on the corresponding web server facilitate the extraction of six distinct SP classes. The more conserved of these can be used for searching cDNA and UniProtKB databases for potential bioactive peptides, for creating PROSITE search patterns, and for phylogenetic analysis.
