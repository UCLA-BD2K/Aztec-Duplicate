A service for evaluating the electron density (and, indirectly, some aspects of the model quality) of crystal structures deposited in the Protein Data Bank. In addition to electron density maps and tools to view these maps, statistics and plots are provided for assessing the goodness-of-fit between the deposited models (structures) and the experimental data represented by the electron density calculated using the models and their associated structure factor amplitudes.
