DroPhEA is a core module of a web application that facilitates research in insect functional genomics through enrichment analysis on mutant phenotypes of fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster). The phenotypes investigated in the analyses can be predefined by FlyBase or customized by users. DroPhEA allows users to specify mutation or ortholog types, displays enriched term results in a hierarchical structure and supports analyses on gene sets of all insect species with a fully sequenced genome.
