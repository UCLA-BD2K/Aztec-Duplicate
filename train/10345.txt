SWiPE (Searching Wikipedia by Example) is a user-friendly interface that allows semantic and well-structured knowledge bases (such as DBpedia) to be easily queried directly from Wikipedia's pages. Using Swipe, naive users with no knowledge of RDF triples and SPARQL can easily query DBpedia with powerful questions like "Find the town in California with less than 10 thousand people". This is accomplished by a novel Search by Example (SBE) approach where a user can enter the query conditions directly on the Infobox of a Wikipedia page. In fact, SWiPE activates various fields of Wikipedia to allow users to enter query conditions, and then uses these conditions to generate equivalent SPARQL queries and execute them on DBpedia. Finally, SWiPE returns the query results in a form that is conducive to query refinements and further explorations.
