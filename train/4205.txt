Motivation: Accurate inference of genealogical relationships between pairs of individuals is paramount in association studies, forensics and evolutionary analyses of wildlife populations. Current methods for relationship inference consider only a small set of close relationships and have limited to no power to distinguish between relationships with the same number of meioses separating the individuals under consideration (e.g. auntâniece versus nieceâaunt or first cousins versus great auntâniece). Results: We present CARROT (ClAssification of Relationships with ROTations), a novel framework for relationship inference that leverages linkage information to differentiate between rotated relationships, that is, between relationships with the same number of common ancestors and the same number of meioses separating the individuals under consideration. We demonstrate that CARROT clearly outperforms existing methods on simulated data. We also applied CARROT on four populations from Phase III of the HapMap Project and detected previously unreported pairs of third-and fourth-degree relatives.
