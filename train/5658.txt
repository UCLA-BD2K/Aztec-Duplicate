Motivation: De novo assembly of a eukaryotic genome with next-generation sequencing data is still a challenging task. Over the past few years several assemblers have been developed, often suitable for one specific type of sequencing data. The number of known genomes is expanding rapidly, therefore it becomes possible to use multiple reference genomes for assembly projects. We introduce an assembly integrator that makes use of all available data, i.e. multiple de novo assemblies and mappings against multiple related genomes, by optimizing a weighted combination of criteria.
