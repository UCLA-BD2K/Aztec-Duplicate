Summary: SensA is a web-based application for sensitivity analysis of mathematical models. The sensitivity analysis is based on metabolic control analysis, computing the local, global and time-dependent properties of model components. Interactive visualization facilitates interpretation of usually complex results. SensA can contribute to the analysis, adjustment and understanding of mathematical models for dynamic systems.
        Availability and implementation: SensA is available at http://gofid.biologie.hu-berlin.de/ and can be used with any modern browser. The source code can be found at https://bitbucket.org/floettma/sensa/ (MIT license)
