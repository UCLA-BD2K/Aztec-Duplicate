A protein's isoelectric point or pI corresponds to the solution pH at which its net surface charge is zero. Since the early days of solution biochemistry, the pI has been recorded and reported, and thus literature reports of pI abound. The Protein Isoelectric Point database (PIP-DB) has collected and collated these data to provide an increasingly comprehensive database for comparison and bench-marking purposes. A web application has been developed to warehouse this database and provide public access to this unique resource. PIP-DB is a web-enabled SQL database with an HTML GUI front-end. PIP-DB is fully searchable across a range of properties. Availability and implementation: The PIP-DB database and documentation are available at http://www.pip
