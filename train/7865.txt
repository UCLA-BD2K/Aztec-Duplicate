MicroRNAs are short non-coding RNA which function to fine-tune protein levels in all cells. This is achieved mainly by sequence-specific binding to 3 0 untranslated regions of target mRNA. The result is post-transcriptional interference in gene expression which reduces protein levels either by promoting destabilisation of mRNA or translational repression. Research published since 2010 shows that microRNAs are important regulators of gene expression in epilepsy. A series of microRNA profiling studies in rodent and human tissue has revealed that epilepsy is associated with wide ranging changes to microRNA levels in the brain. These are thought to influence processes including cell death, inflammation and rewiring of neuronal networks. MicroRNAs have also been identified in the blood after injury to the brain and therefore may serve as biomarkers of epilepsy. EpimiRBase is a manually curated database for researchers interested in the role of microRNAs in epilepsy. The fully searchable database includes information on up-and down-regulated microRNAs in the brain and blood, as well as functional studies, and covers both rodent models and human epilepsy.
