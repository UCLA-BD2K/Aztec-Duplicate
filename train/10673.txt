INSECT is a user-friendly web server to predict the occurrence of Cis-Regulatory Modules (CRMs), which control gene expression. Here, we present a new release of INSECT which includes several new features, such as whole genome analysis, nucleosome occupancy predictions, and which provides additional links to third-party functional tools that complement user capabilities, CRM analysis and hypothesis construction. Improvements in the core implementation have led to a faster and more efficient tool. In addition, this new release introduces a new interface designed for a more integrative and dynamic user experience.
