Saul language enables experts in various fields with minimal experience in machine learning to program and design machine learning models for their application of interest.

Saul provides high level primitives and a principled way for interacting with and learning from messy naturally occurring data from heterogeneous resources. It enables the experts to express their domain knowledge using a high level intuitive language. In addition, it makes a variety of learning and inference algorithms easily accessible and facilitates designing complex and structured prediction models by composing simple building blocks.
