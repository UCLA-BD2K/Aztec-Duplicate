Background: Interpreting non-targeted metabolomics data remains a challenging task. Signals from non-targeted metabolomics studies stem from a combination of biological causes, complex interactions between them and experimental bias/noise. The resulting data matrix usually contain huge number of variables and only few samples, and classical techniques using nonlinear mapping could result in computational complexity and overfitting. Independent Component Analysis (ICA) as a linear method could potentially bring more meaningful results than Principal Component Analysis (PCA). However, a major problem with most ICA algorithms is the output variations between different runs and the result of a single ICA run should be interpreted with reserve.
