CANaLI is a Question Answering system that allows to query RDF Knowledge Bases using a Controlled Natural Language. The English-based language and the autocompletion system, that guides the user in entering well-formed questions, makes CANaLI easy to be learnt and used. The matching of the phrases typed by the user with the elements of the underlying knowledge base is performed on-the-fly and the subsequent translation of the question into a SPARQL query is nearly instant. Results are presented in a user friendly snippet format. The system is implemented as a Java web-application, thus, and it is accessible through any JavaScript-enabled browser.
