A major challenge for mass spectrometric-based lipidomics, aiming at describing all lipid species in a biological sample, lies in the computational and bioinformatic processing of the large amount of data that arises after data acquisition. Lipid-Pro is a software tool that supports the identification of lipids by interpreting large datasets generated by liquid chromatographyâ tandem mass spectrometry (LCâMS/MS) using the advanced data-independent acquisition mode MS E. In the MS E mode, the instrument fragments all molecular ions generated from a sample and records time-resolved molecular ion data as well as fragment ion data for every detectable molecular ion. Lipid-Pro matches the retention time-aligned mass-to-charge ratio data of molecular-and fragment ions with a lipid database and generates a report on all identified lipid species. For generation of the lipid database, Lipid-Pro provides a module for construction of lipid species and their fragments using a flexible building block approach. Hence, Lipid-Pro is an easy to use analysis tool to interpret complex MS E lipidomics data and also offers a module to generate a user-specific lipid database.
