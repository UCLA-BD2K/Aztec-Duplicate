Denoising Algorithm based on Relevance network Topology (DART) is an algorithm designed to evaluate the consistency of prior information molecular signatures (e.g in-vitro perturbation expression signatures) in independent molecular data (e.g gene expression data sets). If consistent, a pruning network strategy is then used to infer the activation status of the molecular signature in individual samples.
