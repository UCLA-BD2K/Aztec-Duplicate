Detecting periodicity in large scale data remains a challenge. While efforts have been made to identify best of breed algorithms, relatively little research has gone into integrating these methods in a generalizable method. Here, we present MetaCycle, an R package that incorporates ARSER, JTK_CYCLE and Lomb-Scargle to conveniently evaluate periodicity in time-series data. MetaCycle has two functions, meta2d and meta3d, designed to analyze two-dimensional and three-dimensional time-series datasets, respectively. Meta2d implements N-version programming concepts using a suite of algorithms and integrating their results. Availability and implementation: MetaCycle package is available on the CRAN repository (https:// cran.r-project.
