Summary
          Automated analysis of flow cytometry (FCM) data is essential for it to become successful as a high throughput technology. We believe that the principles of Trellis graphics can be adapted to provide useful visualizations that can aid such automation. In this article, we describe the R/Bioconductor package flowViz that implements such visualizations.
