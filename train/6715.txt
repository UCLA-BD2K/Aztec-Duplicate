This package gives the implementations microbiome metabolic network constructing and analyzing. It introduces a unique metagenomic systems biology approach, mapping metagenomic data to the KEGG global metabolic pathway and constructing a systems-level network. The system-level network and the next topological analysis will be of great help to analysis the various functional properties, including regulation and metabolic functionality of the metagenome.
