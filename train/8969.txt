The Atlas of UTR Regulatory Activity (AURA) is a manually curated and comprehensive catalog of human mRNA untranslated regions (UTRs) and UTR regulatory annotations. Through its intuitive web interface, it provides full access to a wealth of information on UTRs that integrates phylogenetic conservation, RNA sequence and structure data, single nucleotide variation, gene expression and gene functional descriptions from literature and specialized databases.
