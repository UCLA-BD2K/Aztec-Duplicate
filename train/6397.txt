The public availability of high throughput molecular data provides new opportunities for researchers to advance discovery, replication and validation efforts. One common challenge in leveraging such data is the diversity of measurement approaches and platforms and a lack of utilities enabling cross-platform comparisons among data sources for analysis. We present a method to map DNA methylation data from bisulfite sequencing approaches to CpG sites measured with the widely used Illumina methylation bead-array platforms. Correlations and median absolute deviations support the validity of using bisulfite sequencing data in combination with Illumina bead-array methylation data.
