ICMA, a software framework to create 3D finite element models of the left ventricle from cardiac ultrasound or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data, has been made available as an open-source code. The framework is hardware vendor independent and uses speckle tracking (endocardial border detection) on ultrasound (MRI) imaging data in the form of DICOM. Standard American Heart Association segment-based strain analysis can be performed using a browser-based interface. The speckle tracking, border detection and model fitting methods are implemented in C++ using open-source tools. They are wrapped as web services and orchestrated via a JBOSS-based application server.
                The source code for ICMA is freely available under MPL 1.1 or GPL 2.0 or LGPL 2.1 license at https://github.com/ABI-Software-Laboratory/ICMA and a standalone virtual machine at http://goo.gl/M4lJKH for download.
