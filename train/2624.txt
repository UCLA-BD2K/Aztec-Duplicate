Methods for aggregating ranked lists, especially lists of genes. It implements the Robust Rank Aggregation (RRA) and some other simple algorithms for the task. RRA method uses a probabilistic model for aggregation that isrobust to noise and also facilitates the calculation of significance probabilities for all the elements in the final ranking.
