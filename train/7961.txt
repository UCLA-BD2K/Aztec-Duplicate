In medical research, it is crucial to understand the functional consequences of genetic alterations, for example, non-synonymous single nucleotide variants (nsSNVs). NsSNVs are known to be causative for several human diseases. However, the genetic basis of complex disorders such as diabetes or cancer comprises multiple factors. Methods to analyze putative synergetic effects of multiple such factors, however, are limited. Here, we concentrate on nsSNVs and present BALL-SNPgp, a tool for structural and functional characterization of nsSNVs, which is aimed to improve pathogenicity assessment in computational diagnostics. Based on annotated SNV data, BALL-SNPgp creates a three-dimensional visualization of the encoded protein, collects available information from different resources concerning disease relevance and other functional annotations, performs cluster analysis, predicts putative binding pockets and provides data on known interaction sites. Availability and implementation: BALL-SNPgp is based on the comprehensive C Ã¾Ã¾ framework Biochemical Algorithms Library (BALL) and its visualization front-end BALLView.
