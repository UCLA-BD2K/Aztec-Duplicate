The InfoBox Editor (IBE) is a user-friendly interface that enables users to create and edit structured summaries without requiring any knowledge about the underlying terminology of the summaries. By mining existing text in Wikipedia (or any user-supplied text) on a subject, IBE generates a structured summary about the subject and suggests possibly missing attributes for which the user may want to provide further information.
