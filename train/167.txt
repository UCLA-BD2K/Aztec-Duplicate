Summary: We present BioBlend, a unified API in a high-level language (python) that wraps the functionality of Galaxy and CloudMan APIs. BioBlend makes it easy for bioinformaticians to automate end-to-end large data analysis, from scratch, in a way that is highly accessible to collaborators, by allowing them to both provide the required infrastructure and automate complex analyses over large datasets within the familiar Galaxy environment.
        Availability and implementation:
http://bioblend.readthedocs.org/. Automated installation of BioBlend is available via PyPI (e.g. pip install bioblend). Alternatively, the source code is available from the GitHub repository (https://github.com/afgane/bioblend) under the MIT open source license. The library has been tested and is working on Linux, Macintosh and Windows-based systems.
