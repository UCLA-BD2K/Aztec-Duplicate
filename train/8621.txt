Compilation of genetic maps combined to quantitative trait loci (QTL) meta-analysis has proven to be a powerful approach contributing to the identification of candidate genes underlying quantitative traits. BioMercator was the first software offering a complete set of algorithms and visualization tool covering all steps required to perform QTL meta-analysis. Despite several limitations, the software is still widely used. We developed a new version proposing additional up to date methods and improving graphical representation and exploration of large datasets. Availability and implementation: BioMercator V3 is implemented in JAVA and freely available
