CentiLib is a library and plug-in for the comprehensive analysis and exploration of network centralities. It provides 17 different node centrality and four graph centrality measures in a user-friendly interface and supports the exploration of analysis results within the networks. Its architecture allows for easy adaption to Java-based network analysis, simulation and visualization tools, which is demonstrated by providing the plug-in for two popular network analysis toolsâCytoscape and Vanted. With the ability to quantitatively analyze biological networks in an interactive and visual manner, CentiLib supports a better understanding of complex biological networks and processes.
