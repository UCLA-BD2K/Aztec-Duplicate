Motivation: We developed VISUALGRAPHX, a web-based, interactive visualization tool for large-scale graphs. Current graph visualization tools that follow the rich-internet paradigm lack an interactive and scalable visualization of graph-based data. VISUALGRAPHX aims to provide a universal graph visualization tool that empowers the users to efficiently explore the data for themselves at a large scale.

Availability and Implementation: VISUALGRAPHX has been released as a visualization plugin for the Galaxy platform under AFL 3.0 and is available with instructions and application data at
