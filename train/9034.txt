Life science ontologies substantially change over time to meet the requirements of their users and to include the newest domain knowledge. Thus, an important task is to know what has been modified between two versions of an ontology (diff). This diff should contain all performed changes as compact and understandable as possible. We present CODEX (Complex Ontology Diff Explorer), a tool that allows determining semantic changes between two versions of an ontology, which users can interactively analyze in multiple ways. Availability and implementation: CODEX is available under http://www.izbi.de/codex and is supported by all major browsers. It is implemented in Java based on Google Web Toolkit technology. Additionally, users can access a web service interface to use the diff functionality in their applications and analyses.
