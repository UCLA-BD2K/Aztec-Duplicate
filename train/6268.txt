Copy-number variants (CNVs) are a major form of
genetic variation and a risk factor for various human
diseases, so it is crucial to accurately detect
and characterize them. It is conceivable that allelespecific
reads from high-throughput sequencing
data could be leveraged to both enhance CNV detection
and produce allele-specific copy number (ASCN)
calls. Although statistical methods have been developed
to detect CNVs using whole-genome sequence
(WGS) and/or whole-exome sequence (WES)
data, information from allele-specific read counts
has not yet been adequately exploited. ASGENSENG
incorporates allele-specific read
counts in CNV detection and estimates ASCN using
either WGS or WES data.
