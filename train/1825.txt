The package applies a functional version of principal component analysis (FPCA) to: (1) Process data in wiggle track format (WIG) commonly produced by ChIP-Seq peak callers by applying FPCA over a set of read-enriched regions (ChIP-Seq peaks). This is done in order to shorten the genomic locations accounting for a given proportion of variation among the enrichment-score profiles. The function 'narrowpeaks' allows splitting and trimming binding sites in close proximity to each other, narrowing down the length of the putative transcription factor binding sites while preserving the information present in the variability of the dataset and capturing major sources of variation. (2) Analyse differential variation between multiple ChIP-Seq samples with replicates. The function 'narrowpeaksDiff' quantifies differences between the shapes, and uses Hotelling's T2 tests on the functional principal component scores to identify significant differences across conditions.
