Dual-tree complex wavelet combined with non-local means (DT-CWT-NLM) for Arterial-Spin-Labelling (ASL) fMRI denoising is a software toolbox that can denoise MR images, especially ASL fMRI. The software is typically used as a pre-processing step, reading, denoising and writing NIfTI format images. Variable denoising outcomes are possible by changing certain parameters. The software can also be employed for denoising other MR image types, such as diffusion MRI.
