Motivation: Imaging mass spectrometry has emerged in the past decade as a label-free, spatially resolved and multipurpose bioana-lytical technique for direct analysis of biological samples. However, solving two everyday data analysis problems still requires expert judgment: (i) the detection of unknown molecules and (ii) the testing for presence of known molecules. Results: We developed a measure of spatial chaos of a molecular image corresponding to a mass-to-charge value, which is a proxy for the molecular presence, and developed methods solving considered problems. The statistical evaluation was performed on a data-set from a rat brain section with test sets of molecular images selected by an expert. The measure of spatial chaos has shown high agreement with expert judges. The method for detection of unknown molecules allowed us to find structured molecular images corresponding to spectral peaks of any low intensity. The test for presence applied to a list of endogenous peptides ranked them according to the proposed measure of their presence in the sample. Availability: The source code and test sets of mass-to-charge images are available at
