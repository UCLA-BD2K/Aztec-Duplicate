Superimposing input data over existing genomic references allows for fast, accurate visual comparisons. The GenoView package is a novel bioinformatics package which condenses genomic data tracks to offer a comprehensive view of genetic variants. Its main function is to display mutation data over exons and protein domains, which easily identifies potential genomic locations of interest.
