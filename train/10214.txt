Motivation: Similarity searching and clustering of chemical compounds by structural similarities are important computational approaches for identifying drug-like small molecules. Most algorithms available for these tasks are limited by their speed and scalability, and cannot handle today's large compound databases with several million entries. Results: In this article, we introduce a new algorithm for accelerated similarity searching and clustering of very large compound sets using embedding and indexing (EI) techniques. First, we present EI-Search as a general purpose similarity search method for finding objects with similar features in large databases and apply it here to searching and clustering of large compound sets. The method embeds the compounds in a high-dimensional Euclidean space and searches this space using an efficient index-aware nearest neighbor search method based on locality sensitive hashing (LSH). Second, to cluster large compound sets, we introduce the EI-Clustering algorithm that combines the EI-Search method with JarvisâPatrick clustering. Both methods were tested on three large datasets with sizes ranging from about 260 000 to over 19 million compounds. In comparison to sequential search methods, the EI-Search method was 40â200 times faster, while maintaining comparable recall rates. The EI-Clustering method allowed us to significantly reduce the CPU time required to cluster these large compound libraries from several months to only a few days. Availability: Software implementations and online services have been developed based on the methods introduced in this study. The online services provide access to the generated clustering results and ultra-fast similarity searching of the PubChem Compound database with subsecond response time.
