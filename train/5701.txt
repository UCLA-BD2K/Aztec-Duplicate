The PRIDE PRoteomics IDEntifications (PRIDE) database is a centralized, standards compliant, public data repository for proteomics data, including protein and peptide identifications, post-translational modifications and supporting spectral evidence. PRIDE is a core member in the ProteomeXchange (PX) consortium, which provides a single point for submitting mass spectrometry based proteomics data to public-domain repositories. Datasets are submitted to PRIDE via ProteomeXchange and are handled by expert biocurators.
