Many cell lines can be reprogrammed to other cell lines by forced expression of a few transcription factors or by specifically designed culture methods, which have attracted a great interest in the field of regenerative medicine and stem cell research. Plenty of cell lines have been used to generate induced pluripotent stem cells (IPSCs) by expressing a group of genes and microRNAs. These IPSCs can differentiate into somatic cells to promote tissue regeneration. Similarly, many somatic cells can be directly reprogrammed to other cells without a stem cell state. All these findings are helpful in searching for new reprogramming methods and understanding the biological mechanism inside. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is still no database dedicated to integrating the reprogramming records. We built RPdb (cellular reprogramming database) to collect cellular reprogramming information and make it easy to access. All entries in RPdb are manually extracted from more than 2000 published articles, which is helpful for researchers in regenerative medicine and cell biology. Availability and Implementation: RPdb is freely available on the web at http://bioinformatics.ustc. edu.cn/rpdb with all major browsers supported.
