Biological network analysis can be enhanced by examining the connections between nodes and the rest of the network. For this purpose we have developed GraphletCounter, an open-source software tool for computing graphlet degree signatures that can operate on its own or as a plug-in to the network analysis environment Cytoscape. A unique characteristic of GraphletCounter is its ability to compute the graphlet signatures of network motifs, which can be specified by files generated by the motif-finding tool mfinder. GraphletCounter displays graphlet signatures for visual inspection within Cytoscape, and can output graphlet data for integration with larger workflows. Availability and implementation: GraphletCounter is implemented in Java. It can be downloaded from the Cytoscape plugin repository, and is also available at http://sonmezsysbio.org/software/
