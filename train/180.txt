flowDensity facilitates reproducible, high-throughput analysis of flow cytometry data by automating a predefined manual gating approach. The algorithm is based on a sequential bivariate gating approach that generates a set of predefined cell populations. It chooses the best cut-off for individual markers using characteristics of the density distribution. The Supplementary Material is linked to the online version of the manuscript.
