Modern scientific investigation is generating increasingly larger datasets, yet analyzing these data with current tools is challenging. DIVE is a software framework intended to facilitate big data analysis and reduce the time to scientific insight. Here, we present features of the framework and demonstrate DIVE's application to the Dynameomics project, looking specifically at two proteins. Availability and implementation: Binaries and documentation are available at http://www.dynameomics.org/DIVE/DIVESetup.exe.
