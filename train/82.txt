Summary: Prioritization of candidate genes emanating from large-scale screens requires integrated analyses at the genomics, molecular, network and structural biology levels. We have extended the Integrated Genome Browser (IGB) to facilitate these tasks. The graphical user interface greatly simplifies building disease networks and zooming in at atomic resolution to identify variations in molecular complexes that may affect molecular interactions in the context of genomic data. All results are summarized in genome tracks and can be visualized and analyzed at the transcript level.
        Availability and implementation: The MI Bundle is a plugin for the IGB. The plugin, help, video and tutorial are available at http://cru.genomics.iit.it/igbmibundle/ and https://github.com/CRUiit/igb-mi-bundle/wiki. The source code is released under the Apache License, Version 2.
