Motivation: Membrane proteins are clinically relevant, yet their crystal structures are rare. Models of membrane proteins are typically built from template structures with low sequence identity to the target sequence , using a sequence-structure alignment as a blueprint. This alignment is usually made with programs designed for use on soluble proteins. Biological membranes have layers of varying hydrophobicity, and membrane proteins have different amino-acid substitution preferences from their soluble counterparts. Here we include these factors into an alignment method to improve alignments and consequently improve membrane protein models. Results: We developed Membrane Protein Threader (MP-T), a sequence-structure alignment tool for membrane proteins based on multiple sequence alignment. Alignment accuracy is tested against seven other alignment methods over 165 non-redundant alignments of membrane proteins. MP-T produces more accurate alignments than all other methods tested (F M from þ0.9 to þ5.5%). Alignments generated by MP-T also lead to significantly better models than those of the best alternative alignment tool (one-fourth of models see an increase in GDT_TS of !4%).
