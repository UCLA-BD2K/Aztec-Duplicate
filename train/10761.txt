We present a new, extended version of the Protein Topology Graph Library web server. The Protein Topology Graph Library describes the protein topology on the super-secondary structure level. It allows to compute and visualize protein ligand graphs and search for protein structural motifs. The new server features additional information on ligand binding to secondary structure elements, increased usability and an application programming interface (API) to retrieve data, allowing for an automated analysis of protein topology. Availability and implementation: The Protein Topology Graph Library server is freely available on the web at
