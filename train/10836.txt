Motivation: While the manually curated Gene Ontology (GO) is widely used, inferring a GO directly from-omics data is a compelling new problem. Recognizing that ontologies are a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of terms and hierarchical relations, algorithms are needed that: (1) analyze a full matrix of geneâgene pairwise similarities from-omics data; (2) infer true hierarchical structure in these data rather than enforcing hierarchy as a computational artifact; and (3) respect biological pleiotropy, by which a term in the hierarchy can relate to multiple higher level terms. Methods addressing these requirements are just beginning to emergeânone has been evaluated for GO inference. Methods: We consider two algorithms [Clique Extracted Ontology (CliXO), LocalFitness] that uniquely satisfy these requirements, compared with methods including standard clustering. CliXO is a new approach that finds maximal cliques in a network induced by progressive thresholding of a similarity matrix. We evaluate each method's ability to reconstruct the GO biological process ontology from a similarity matrix based on (a) semantic similarities for GO itself or (b) three-omics datasets for yeast. Results: For task (a) using semantic similarity, CliXO accurately reconstructs GO (499% precision, recall) and outperforms other approaches (520% precision, 520% recall). For task (b) using-omics data, CliXO outperforms other methods using two-omics datasets and achieves $30% precision and recall using YeastNet v3, similar to an earlier approach (Network Extracted Ontology) and better than LocalFitness or standard clustering (20â25% precision, recall). Conclusion: This study provides algorithmic foundation for building gene ontologies by capturing hierarchical and pleiotropic structure embedded in biomolecular data.
