IBminer is a novel NLP-based system for deriving summary information from free text in the form of subject-attribute-value triples. IBminer employs the SemScape text mining framework to generate a set of subject-attribute-value triples from free text, and maps the attributes to those introduced by IBminer. The mapping is performed using the categorical information of subject and values, as well as the existing matches between generated triples and the ones in current InfoBoxes. Our experiments showed that IBminer generates high-quality results when processing large scale textual documents.
