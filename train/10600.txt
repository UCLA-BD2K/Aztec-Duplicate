ArchSchema is a Java Web Start application that generates a dynamic 2D network of related Pfam domain architectures. Each node corresponds to a different architecture (shown as a sequence of coloured boxes) and indicates whether any 3D structural information is available in the PDB. Satellite nodes can show either the UniProt codes or the PDB codes of proteins having the given architecture. Search options allow search by UniProt code or Pfam domain identifier, and results can be filtered by domain, organism, or by selecting only proteins in the PDB. Availability: ArchSchema can be freely accessed at
