Description: Adenosiland represents the first attempt of an integrated bioinformatics and chemoinformatics web-resource dedicated to adenosine receptors. This informatics platform provides a wide-ranging of structure based and ligand based query functions to facilitate the exploration of adenosine receptor structures from primary sequences to three-dimensional architectures. Here, we present an overview of Adenosiland platform describing the most valuable searching tools and their functionalities.
