Mate pair library sequencing is an effective and economical method for detecting genomic structural variants and chromo-somal abnormalities. Unfortunately, the mapping and alignment of mate-pair read pairs to a reference genome is a challenging and time-consuming process for most next-generation sequencing alignment programs. Large insert sizes, introduction of library preparation protocol artifacts (biotin junction reads, paired-end read contamination , chimeras, etc.) and presence of structural variant breakpoints within reads increase mapping and alignment complexity. We describe an algorithm that is up to 20 times faster and 25% more accurate than popular next-generation sequencing alignment programs when processing mate pair sequencing.
