The prebs package aims at making RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) data more comparable to microarray data. The comparability is achieved by summarizing sequencing-based expressions of probe regions using a modified version of RMA algorithm. The pipeline takes mapped reads in BAM format as an input and produces either gene expressions or original microarray probe set expressions as an output.
