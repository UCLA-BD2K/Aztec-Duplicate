The application of proteinâprotein docking in large-scale interactome analysis is a major challenge in structural bioinformatics and requires huge computing resources. In this work, we present MEGADOCK 4.0, an FFT-based docking software that makes extensive use of recent heterogeneous supercomputers and shows powerful , scalable performance of 497% strong scaling. Availability and Implementation: MEGADOCK 4.0 is written in C+ + with OpenMPI and NVIDIA CUDA 5.0 (or later) and is freely available to all academic and non-profit users at:
