Motivation: The completion of 168 genome sequences from a single population of Drosophila melanogaster provides a global view of genomic variation and an understanding of the evolutionary forces shaping the patterns of DNA polymorphism and divergence along the genome. Results: We present the 'Population Drosophila Browser' (PopDrowser), a new genome browser specially designed for the automatic analysis and representation of genetic variation across the D. melanogaster genome sequence. PopDrowser allows estimating and visualizing the values of a number of DNA polymorphism and divergence summary statistics, linkage disequilibrium parameters and several neutrality tests. PopDrowser also allows performing custom analyses on-the-fly using user-selected parameters. Availability: PopDrowser is freely available from http://PopDrowser .
