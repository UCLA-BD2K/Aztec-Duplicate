Advances in sequencing technology have greatly reduced the costs incurred in collecting raw sequencing data. Academic laboratories and researchers therefore now have access to very large data-sets of genomic alterations but limited time and computational resources to analyse their potential biological importance. Here, we provide a web-based application, Cancer-Related Analysis of Variants Toolkit, designed with an easy-to-use interface to facilitate the high-throughput assessment and prioritization of genes and mis-sense alterations important for cancer tumorigenesis. Cancer-Related Analysis of Variants Toolkit provides predictive scores for germline variants , somatic mutations and relative gene importance, as well as annotations from published literature and databases. Results are emailed to users as MS Excel spreadsheets and/or tab-separated text files.
