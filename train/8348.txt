Motivation: Probabilistic motif detection requires a multi-step approach going from the actual de novo regulatory motif finding up to a tedious assessment of the predicted motifs. MotifSuite, a user-friendly web interface streamlines this analysis flow. Its core consists of two post-processing procedures that allow prioritizing the motif detection output. The tools offered by MotifSuite are built around the well-established motif detection tool MotifSampler and can also be used in combination with any other probabilistic motif detection tool. Elaborate guidelines on each of its applications have been provided.
