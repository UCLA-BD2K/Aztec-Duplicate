We introduce pyRMSD, an open source standalone Python package that aims at offering an integrative and efficient way of performing Root Mean Square Deviation (RMSD)-related calculations of large sets of structures. It is specially tuned to do fast collective RMSD calculations, as pairwise RMSD matrices, implementing up to three well-known superposition algorithms. pyRMSD provides its own symmetric distance matrix class that, besides the fact that it can be used as a regular matrix, helps to save memory and increases memory access speed. This last feature can dramatically improve the overall performance of any Python algorithm using it. In addition, its extensi-bility, testing suites and documentation make it a good choice to those in need of a workbench for developing or testing new algorithms.
