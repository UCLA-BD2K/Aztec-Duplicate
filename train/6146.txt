Motivation: Bacterial luciferases are heterodimeric enzymes that catalyze a chemical reaction, so called bioluminescence, which causes light emission in bacteria. Bioluminescence is vastly used as a reporter system in research tools and commercial developments. However, the details of the mechanisms that stabilize and transform the reaction intermediates as well as differences in the en-zymatic kinetics amongst different bacterial luciferases remain to be elucidated. Results: Amino acid sequences alignments for 21 bacterial luciferases (both a-and b-subunits) were analyzed. For a-subunit, containing the enzyme active center, 48 polymorphic amino acid positions were identified. According to them, the sequences fell into two distinct groups known as slow and fast based on the decay rate of the bioluminescence reaction. The differences in the enzyme active site induced by structural polymorphism are analyzed. Availability and implementation: Three-dimensional models of Photobacterium leiognathi lucifer-ase and Vibrio harveyi luciferase (with reconstructed mobile loop) are freely available at PMDB database: PM0080525 and PM0080526, respectively.
