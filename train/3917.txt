IMSDB is a comprehensive database application and analysis platform that is capable of combining metabolic data, like IMS chromatograms, and heterogeneous biomedical data, like patient records, into a centralized data structure. In contrast to existing work, such as that of Lesniak et al. 2007, the ontology component enables the storage of constantly evolving object-attribute-data. In addition, the peak component ensures the fast storage and retrieval of metabolic data. As opposed to the open source database TrialDB [LINK], a database model was designed, not only utilizing the EAV principal but also including simple classes and relations. The developed IMS database application offers a graphical user interface (GUI) which includes several windows, tabs, buttons and dialogues to provide an intuitive interaction between end-user and application.
