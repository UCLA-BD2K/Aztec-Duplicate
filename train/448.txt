The iHOP (Information Hyperlinked over Proteins) resource uses text-mining methods to identify information on specific genes and proteins, their physical interactions and regulatory relationships, their relevance in pathologies, and their interactions with chemical compounds. iHOP parses thousands of PubMed documents every day and collects information specific to thousands of different biological molecules.
