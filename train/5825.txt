PSEA-Quant is a protein set enrichment analysis algorithm for label-free and label-based mass spectrometry-based quantitative proteomics. It identifies protein sets from the Gene Ontology and Molecular Signature databases that are statistically significantly enriched with abundant proteins, which are measured with high reproducibility across a set of replicates.
