Motivation: A number of inconsistencies in genome annotations are documented among bacterial strains. Visualization of the differences may help biologists to make correct decisions in spurious cases. Results: We have developed a visualization tool, CAMBerVis, to support comparative analysis of multiple bacterial strains. The software manages simultaneous visualization of multiple bacterial genomes, enabling visual analysis focused on genome structure annotations. Availability: The CAMBerVis software is freely available at the project website: http://bioputer.mimuw.edu.pl/camber. Input datasets for Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Staphylocacus aureus are integrated with the software as examples.
