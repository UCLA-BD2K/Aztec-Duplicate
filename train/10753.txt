Motivation: The development of computational tools to enable testing and analysis of high-throughputâsequencing data is essential to modern genomics research. However, although multiple frameworks have been developed to facilitate access to these tools, comparatively little effort has been made at implementing low-level programming libraries to increase the speed and ease of their development. Results: We propose NGSÃ¾Ã¾, a programming library in CÃ¾Ã¾11 specialized in manipulating both next-generation sequencing (NGS) data-sets and genomic information files. This library allows easy integration of new formats and rapid prototyping of new functionalities with a focus on the analysis of genomic regions and features. It offers a powerful, yet versatile and easily extensible interface to read, write and manipulate multiple genomic file formats. By standardizing the internal data structures and presenting a common interface to the data parser, NGSÃ¾Ã¾ offers an effective framework for epigenomics tool development. Availability: NGSÃ¾Ã¾ was written in CÃ¾Ã¾ using the CÃ¾Ã¾11 standard. It requires minimal efforts to build and is well-documented via a complete docXygen guide, online documentation and tutorials. Source code, tests, code examples and documentation are available via the website at http://www.ngsplusplus.ca and the github repository at https://github.com/NGS-lib/NGSplusplus.
