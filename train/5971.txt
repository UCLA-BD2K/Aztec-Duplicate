The currently available functional enrichment software focuses mostly on gene expression analysis, whereby server-and graphical-user-interface-based tools with specific scope dominate the field. Here we present an efficient, user-friendly, multifunctional command-line-based functional enrichment tool (fu-en-to), tailored for the bioinformatics researcher. Availability and implementation: Source code and binaries freely available for download at github.com/DavidWeichselbaum/fuento, implemented in C++ and supported on Linux and OS X. Contact:
