RNA secondary structure analysis often requires searching for potential helices in large sequence data. We present a utility program that efficiently locates potential helical regions under RNA base pairing rules, which include Watson-Crick as well as G-U pairs. It accepts a target and a query set of sequences, and determines all exact matches under RNA rules between target and query sequences that exceed a specified length.
