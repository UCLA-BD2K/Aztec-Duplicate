Summary
        We introduce a simple-to-use graphical tool that enables researchers to easily prepare time-of-flight mass spectrometry data for analysis. For ease of use, the graphical executable provides default parameter settings experimentally determined to work well in most situations. These values can be changed by the user if desired. PrepMS is a stand-alone application made freely available (open source), and is under the General Public License (GPL). Its graphical user interface, default parameter settings, and display plots allow PrepMS to be used effectively for data preprocessing, peak detection, and visual data quality assessment.
