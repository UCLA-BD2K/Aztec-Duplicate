STAN (STrand-specic ANnotation of genomic data) implements bidirectional Hidden Markov Models (bdHMM), which are designed for studying directed genomic processes, such as gene transcription, DNA replication, recombination or DNA repair by integrating genomic data. bdHMMs model a sequence of successive observations (e.g. ChIP or RNA measurements along the genome) by a discrete number of 'directed genomic states', which e.g. reflect distinct genome-associated complexes. Unlike standard HMM approaches, bdHMMs allow the integration of strand-specific (e.g. RNA) and non strand-specific data (e.g. ChIP).
