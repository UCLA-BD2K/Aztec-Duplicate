Protein-coding genes with multiple alternative polyadenylation sites can generate mRNA 3 0 UTR sequences of different lengths, thereby causing the loss or gain of regulatory elements , which can affect stability, localization and translation efficiency. 3USS is a web-server developed with the aim of giving experimentalists the possibility to automatically identify alternative 3 0 UTRs (shorter or longer with respect to a reference transcriptome), an option that is not available in standard RNA-seq data analysis procedures. The tool reports as putative novel the 3 0 UTRs not annotated in available databases. Furthermore, if data from two related samples are uploaded, common and specific alternative 3 0 UTRs are identified and reported by the server.
