Motivation: Stable isotope-labelling experiments have recently
gained increasing popularity in metabolomics studies, providing unique insights into the
dynamics of metabolic fluxes, beyond the steady-state information gathered by routine mass
spectrometry. However, most liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry data analysis
software lacks features that enable automated annotation and relative quantification of
labelled metabolite peaks. Here, we describe mzMatch–ISO, a new
extension to the metabolomics analysis pipeline mzMatch.R.
        Results: Targeted and untargeted isotope profiling using mzMatch–ISO
provides a convenient visual summary of the quality and quantity of labelling for every
metabolite through four types of diagnostic plots that show (i) the chromatograms of the
isotope peaks of each compound in each sample group; (ii) the ratio of mono-isotopic and
labelled peaks indicating the fraction of labelling; (iii) the average peak area of
mono-isotopic and labelled peaks in each sample group; and (iv) the trend
in the relative amount of labelling in a predetermined isotopomer. To aid further
statistical analyses, the values used for generating these plots are also provided as a
tab-delimited file. We demonstrate the power and versatility of
mzMatch–ISO by analysing a 13C-labelled metabolome dataset
from trypanosomal parasites.
        Availability: mzMatch.R and mzMatch–ISO are available free of charge
from http://mzmatch.sourceforge.net
and can be used on Linux and Windows platforms running the latest version of R.
