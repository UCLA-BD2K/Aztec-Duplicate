Background: Scaffolding is an essential step in the genome assembly process. Current methods based on large fragment paired-end reads or long reads allow an increase in contiguity but often lack consistency in repetitive regions, resulting in fragmented assemblies. Here, we describe a novel tool to link assemblies to a genome map to aid complex genome reconstruction by detecting assembly errors and allowing scaffold ordering and anchoring.
