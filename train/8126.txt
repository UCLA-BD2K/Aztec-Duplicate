FISICO is a software tool to perform fast segmentation corrections of medical images. The tool allows the user to load existing segmentations and corresponding images, and perform in-plane contour corrections that are transformed into 3D shape updates through a fast free-form deformation model, enabling with this a considerable improvement in the time necessary to correct segmented images.
