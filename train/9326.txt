Analysis of high throughput metabolomics experiments is a resource-intensive process that includes pre-processing, pre-treatment and post-processing at each level of experimental hierarchy. We developed an interactive user-friendly online software called Metabolite Data Analysis Tool (MetDAT) for mass spectrometry data. It offers a pipeline of tools for file handling, data pre-processing, univariate and multivariate statistical analyses, database searching and pathway mapping. Outputs are produced in the form of text and high-quality images in real-time. MetDAT allows users to combine data management and experiment-centric workflows for optimization of metabolomics methods and metabolite analysis.
