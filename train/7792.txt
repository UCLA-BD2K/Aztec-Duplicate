"This project, developed at University College London, contains programs to perform EM based segmentation of images in nifti or analyse format.seg_EM is a general purpose intensity based image segmentation tool. In it's simplest form, it takes in one 2D or 3D image and segments it in n classes. This function has implemented several other improvements (Please click the hyperlinks to go to specific sections): â¢	Masking for region-of-interest selection [link] â¢	Input anatomical priors, either as a series of images or as a 4D image. These priors should be pre-registered [link] â¢	Markov Random Field for spatial consistency [link] â¢	Bias field inhomogeneity correction to compensate for B0 non-uniformities. The Bias corrected image can also be outputted [link] â¢	Outlier detection as in Van Leemput et al. TMI (2003) [link] â¢ Prior relaxation as in Cardoso et al. MICCAI (2011) [link] â¢	Semi-conjugate prior over the model parameters as explained in Cardoso et al. MICCAI (2011) "
