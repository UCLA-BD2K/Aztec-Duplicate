Prequips is a Java-based, modular software platform for integration, visualization and analysis of complex proteomics mass spectrometry data sets. The software has a graphical user interface and provides access to data produced by data analysis pipelines such as the Trans-Proteomic Pipeline. It bridges the gap between data processing pipelines and high-level analysis tools used in Systems Biology.
