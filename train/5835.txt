Strand specific peak-pair calling in ChIP-exo replicates. The cumulative Skellam distribution function (package 'skellam') is used to detect significant normalized count differences of opposed sign at each DNA strand (peak-pairs). Irreproducible discovery rate for overlapping peak-pairs across biological replicates is estimated using the package 'idr'.
