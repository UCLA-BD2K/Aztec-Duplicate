The Python-based, open-source eMZed framework was developed for mass spectrometry (MS) users to create tailored work-flows for liquid chromatography (LC)/MS data analysis. The goal was to establish a unique framework with comprehensive basic function-alities that are easy to apply and allow for the extension and modification of the framework in a straightforward manner. eMZed supports the iterative development and prototyping of individual evaluation strategies by providing a computing environment and tools for inspecting and modifying underlying LC/MS data. The framework specifically addresses non-expert programmers, as it requires only basic knowledge of Python and relies largely on existing successful open-source software, e.g. OpenMS.
