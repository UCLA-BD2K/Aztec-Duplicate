Founded upon the database of 570 public signatures, ICPS is a web-based application to obtain biomarker profiles among 11 common cancers by integrating genomic alterations with transcription signatures on the basis of a previously developed integrative pipeline. ICPS supports both public data and user's in-house data, and performs meta-analysis at a cancer subtype level by combining heterogeneous datasets. Finally, ICPS returns the robust gene signature containing potential cancer biomarkers that may be useful to carcinogenesis study and clinical cancer diagnosis. Availability:
