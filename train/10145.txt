Motivation: In an infectious disease, the pathogen's strategy to enter the host organism and breach its immune defenses often involves interactions between the host and pathogen proteins. Currently, the experimental data on hostâpathogen interactions (HPIs) are scattered across multiple databases, which are often specialized to target a specific disease or host organism. An accurate and efficient method for the automated extraction of HPIs from biomedical literature is crucial for creating a unified repository of HPI data. Results: Here, we introduce and compare two new approaches to automatically detect whether the title or abstract of a PubMed publication contains HPI data, and extract the information about organisms and proteins involved in the interaction. The first approach is a feature-based supervised learning method using support vector machines (SVMs). The SVM models are trained on the features derived from the individual sentences. These features include names of the host/pathogen organisms and corresponding proteins or genes, keywords describing HPI-specific information, more general proteinâprotein interaction information, experimental methods and other statistical information. The language-based method employed a link grammar parser combined with semantic patterns derived from the training examples. The approaches have been trained and tested on manually curated HPI data. When compared to a naÃ¯ve approach based on the existing proteinâprotein interaction literature mining method, our approaches demonstrated higher accuracy and recall in the classification task. The most accurate, feature-based, approach achieved 66â73% accuracy, depending on the test protocol.
