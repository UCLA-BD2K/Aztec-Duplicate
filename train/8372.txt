iMAT is an Integrative Metabolic Analysis Tool, enabling the integration of transcriptomic and proteomic data with genome-scale metabolic network models to predict enzymes' metabolic flux, based on the method previously described by Shlomi et al. The prediction of metabolic fluxes based on high-throughput molecular data sources could help to advance our understanding of cellular metabolism, since current experimental approaches are limited to measuring fluxes through merely a few dozen enzymes.
