Deep tissue imaging is increasingly used for non-destructive interrogation of intact organs and small model organisms. An intuitive approach to increase the imaging depth by almost a factor of 2 is to record a sample from two sides and fuse both image stacks. However, imperfect three-dimensional alignment of both stacks presents a computational challenge. We have developed a FIJI plugin, called BiDiFuse, which merges bi-directionally recorded image stacks via 3D rigid transformations. The method is broadly applicable, considering its compatibility with all optical sectioning microscopes and does not rely on fiducial markers for image registration.
