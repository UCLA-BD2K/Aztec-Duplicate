Cytochrome P450 (CYPs) are the major enzymes involved in drug metabolism and bio-activation. Inhibition models were constructed for five of the most popular enzymes from the CYP superfamily in human liver. The five enzymes chosen for this study, namely CYP1A2, CYP2D6, CYP2C19, CYP2C9 and CYP3A4, account for 90% of the xenobiotic and drug metabolism in human body. CYP enzymes can be inhibited or induced by various drugs or chemical compounds. In this work, a rule-based CYP inhibition prediction online server, CypRules, was created based on predict-ive models generated by the rule-based C5.0 algorithm. CypRules can predict and provide structural rulesets for CYP inhibition for each compound uploaded to the server. Capable of fast execution performance, it can be used for virtual high-throughput screening (VHTS) of a large set of testing compounds. Availability and implementation: CypRules is freely accessible at
