Snap.py is a Python interface for SNAP. SNAP is a general purpose, high performance system for analysis and manipulation of large networks. SNAP is written in C++ and optimized for maximum performance and compact graph representation. It easily scales to massive networks with hundreds of millions of nodes, and billions of edges.

Snap.py provides performance benefits of SNAP, combined with flexibility of Python. Most of the SNAP functionality is available via Snap.py in Python.
