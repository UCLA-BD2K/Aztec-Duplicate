The human complement system is increasingly perceived as an intricate protein network of effectors, inhibitors and regulators that drives critical processes in health and disease and extensively communicates with associated physiological pathways ranging from immunity and inflammation to homeostasis and development. A steady stream of experimental data reveals new fascinating connections at a rapid pace; although opening unique opportunities for research discoveries, the comprehensiveness and large diversity of experimental methods, nomenclatures and publication sources renders it highly challenging to keep up with the essential findings. With the Complement Map Database (CMAP), we have created a novel and easily accessible research tool to assist the complement community and scientists from related disciplines in exploring the complement network and discovering new connections.
