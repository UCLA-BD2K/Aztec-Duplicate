In chemoinformatics and bioinformatics fields, one of the main computational challenges in various predictive modeling is to find a suitable way to effectively represent the molecules under investigation , such as small molecules, proteins and even complex interactions. To solve this problem, we developed a freely available R/Bioconductor package, called CompoundâProtein Interaction with R (Rcpi), for complex molecular representation from drugs, proteins and more complex interactions, including proteinâprotein and compoundâ protein interactions. Rcpi could calculate a large number of structural and physicochemical features of proteins and peptides from amino acid sequences, molecular descriptors of small molecules from their topology and proteinâprotein interaction and compoundâprotein interaction descriptors. In addition to main functionalities, Rcpi could also provide a number of useful auxiliary utilities to facilitate the user's need. With the descriptors calculated by this package, the users could conveniently apply various statistical machine learning methods in R to solve various biological and drug research questions in computational biology and drug discovery. Availability and implementation: Rcpi is freely available from the Bioconductor site
