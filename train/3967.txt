Motivation: The Î²-barrel is a ubiquitous fold that is deployed to accomplish a wide variety of biological functions including membrane-embedded pores. Key influences of Î²-barrel lumen diameter include the number of Î²-strands (n) and the degree of shear (S), the latter value measuring the extent to which the Î²-sheet is tilted within the Î²-barrel. Notably, it has previously been reported that the shear value for small antiparallel Î²-barrels (n â¤ 24) typically ranges between n and 2n. Conversely, it has been suggested that the Î²-strands in giant antiparallel Î²-barrels, such as those formed by pore forming cholesterol-dependent cytolysins (CDC), are parallel relative to the axis of the Î²-barrel, i.e. S = 0. The S = 0 arrangement, however, has never been observed in crystal structures of small Î²-barrels. Therefore, the structural basis for how CDCs form a Î²-barrel and span a membrane remains to be understood. Results: Through comparison of molecular models with experimental data, we are able to identify how giant CDC Î²-barrels utilize a 'near parallel' arrangement of Î²-strands where S = n/2. Furthermore, we show how side-chain packing within the Î²-barrel lumen is an important limiting factor with respect to the possible shear values for small Î²-barrels (n â¤ 24 Î²-strands). In contrast, our models reveal no such limitation restricts the shear value of giant Î²-barrels (n  24 Î²-strands). Giant Î²-barrels can thus access a different architecture compared with smaller Î²-barrels.
