We present PARSEC (PAtteRn Search and Contextualization), a new open source platform for guided discovery, allowing localization and biological characterization of short genomic sites in entire eukaryotic genomes. PARSEC can search for a sequence or a degenerated pattern. The retrieved set of genomic sites can be characterized in terms of (i) conservation in model organisms , (ii) genomic context (proximity to genes) and (iii) function of neighboring genes. These modules allow the user to explore, visualize, filter and extract biological knowledge from a set of short genomic regions such as transcription factor binding sites. Availability: Web site implemented in Java, JavaScript and CÃ¾Ã¾, with all major browsers supported. Freely available at lbgi.fr/parsec. Source code is freely available at sourceforge.net/projects/genomicparsec.
