We developed a modular and scalable framework called Eoulsan, based on the Hadoop implementation of the MapReduce algorithm dedicated to high-throughput sequencing data analysis. Eoulsan allows users to easily set up a cloud computing cluster and automate the analysis of several samples at once using various software solutions available. Our tests with Amazon Web Services demonstrated that the computation cost is linear with the number of instances booked as is the running time with the increasing amounts of data.
