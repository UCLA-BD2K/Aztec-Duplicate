Presents an improved data analysis pipeline based on a new peak picking method for exploring imaging mass spectrometry data. EXIMS consists of five consecutive main steps: where the first step involves spectra preprocessing. Then, Sliding Window Normalization (SWN) is used to normalize the spectra and limit the influence of high intensity peaks. Third, image de-noising and contrast enhancement are used to improve the visualization of intensity images. Fourth, peak picking is performed by processing the individual intensity images. Finally, intensity images are clustered using the fuzzy cmeans clustering algorithm.
