The reliable detection of RNA editing sites from massive sequencing data remains challenging and, although several methodol-ogies have been proposed, no computational tools have been released to date. Here, we introduce REDItools a suite of python scripts to perform high-throughput investigation of RNA editing using next-generation sequencing data. Availability and implementation: REDItools are in python programming language and freely available at
