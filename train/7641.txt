G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) comprise the largest family of integral membrane proteins. They are the most important class of drug targets. While there exist crystal structures for only a very few GPCR sequences, numerous experiments have been performed on GPCRs to identify the critical residues and motifs. GPCRRD database is designed to systematically collect all experimental restraints (including residue orientation, contact and distance maps) available from the literature and primary GPCR resources using an automated text mining algorithm combined with manual validation, with the purpose of assisting GPCR 3D structure modeling and function annotation. The current dataset contains thousands of spatial restraints from mutagenesis, disulfide mapping distances, electron cryo-microscopy and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy experiments.
