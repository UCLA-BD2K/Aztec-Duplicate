CLUBS+ provides a  clustering algorithm that offers  major advantages over current algorithms for around-centroids clustering.  In fact, CLUBS+ is (i) totally unsupervised, (ii) significantly faster, and (iii)  producing very high-quality results. For that, CLUBS+ uses a combination of divisive,  agglomerative, and partitional approaches, that has been shown to outperform  other centroid clustering methods on both synthetic and real-life data sets.
