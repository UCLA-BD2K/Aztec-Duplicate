High-quality enzyme function annotation is essential for understanding the biochemistry, metabolism and disease processes of organisms. Previously, we developed a multi-component high-precision enzyme function predictor, EFICAz 2 (enzyme function inference by a combined approach). Here, we present an updated improved version, EFICAz 2.5 , that is trained on a significantly larger data set of enzyme sequences and PROSITE patterns. We also present the results of the application of EFICAz 2.5 to the enzyme reanno-tation of 396 genomes cataloged in the ENSEMBL database. Availability: The EFICAz 2.5 server and database is freely available with a use-friendly interface at
