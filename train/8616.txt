About MyFreePACS MyFreePACS is a free web-based radiology image storage and viewing tool. MyFreePACS was developed to provide an easy-to-use, HIPAA-compliant method for viewing Radiology images from anywhere on a hospital network, or remotely over VPN. MyFreePACS uses a full DICOM server to receive and store images, and then is able to transmit them over the web to the MyFreePACS web client. The MyFreePACS web client is a web page that utilizes an ActiveX control for viewing and manipulation of images.
