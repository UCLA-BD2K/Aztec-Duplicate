Motivation: microRNAs are short non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression by inhibiting target mRNA genes. Next-generation sequencing combined with bioinformatics analyses provide an opportunity to predict numerous novel miRNAs. The efficiency of these predictions relies on the set of positive and negative controls used. We demonstrate that commonly used positive and negative controls may be unreliable and provide a rational methodology with which to replace them.
