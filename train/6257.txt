Hilbert curves enable high-resolution visualization of genomic data on a chromosome-or genome-wide scale. Here we present the HilbertCurve package that provides an easy-to-use interface for mapping genomic data to Hilbert curves. The package transforms the curve as a virtual axis, thereby hiding the details of the curve construction from the user. HilbertCurve supports multiple-layer overlay that makes it a powerful tool to correlate the spatial distribution of multiple feature types.
