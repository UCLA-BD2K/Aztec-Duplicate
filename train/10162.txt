Modern sequencing platforms produce huge amounts of data. Archiving them raises major problems but is crucial for reprodu-cibility of results, one of the most fundamental principles of science. The widely used gzip compressor, used for reduction of storage and transfer costs, is not a perfect solution, so a few specialized FASTQ compressors were proposed recently. Unfortunately, they are often impractical because of slow processing, lack of support for some variants of FASTQ files or instability. We propose DSRC 2 that offers compression ratios comparable with the best existing solutions, while being a few times faster and more flexible. Availability and Implementation: DSRC 2 is freely available at http:// sun.aei.polsl.pl/dsrc. The package contains command-line compres-sor, C and Python libraries for easy integration with existing software and technical documentation with examples of usage.
