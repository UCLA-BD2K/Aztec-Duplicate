This package estimate the proliferation of a cell population in cell-tracking dye studies. The package uses an R implementation of the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm (minpack.lm) to fit a set of peaks (corresponding to different generations of cells) over the proliferation-tracking dye distribution in a FACS experiment.
