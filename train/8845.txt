IRootLab is a free and open-source MATLAB toolbox for vibrational biospectroscopy (VBS) data analysis. It offers an object-oriented programming class library, graphical user interfaces (GUIs) and automatic MATLAB code generation. The class library contains a large number of methods, concepts and visualizations for VBS data analysis, some of which are introduced in the toolbox. The GUIs provide an interface to the class library, including a module to merge several spectral files into a dataset. Automatic code allows developers to quickly write VBS data analysis scripts and is a unique resource among tools for VBS. Documentation includes a manual, tutorials, Doxygen-generated reference and a demonstration showcase. IRootLab can handle some of the most popular file formats used in VBS. License: GNU-LGPL.
