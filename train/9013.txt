Standard transcriptomics measures total cellular RNA levels. Our understanding of gene regulation would be greatly improved if we could measure RNA synthesis and decay rates on a genome-wide level. To that end, the Dynamic Transcriptome Analysis (DTA) method has been developed. DTA combines metabolic RNA labeling with standard transcriptomics to measure RNA synthesis and decay rates in a precise and non-perturbing manner. Here, we present the open source R/Bioconductor software package DTA. It implements all required bioinformatics steps that allow the accurate absolute quantification and comparison of RNA turnover.
