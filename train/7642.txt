spliceR is an R package that allows for classification of full length transcripts generated by RNA-seq assemblers such as Cufflinks. spliceR outputs information about classes of alternative splicing, susceptibility of transcripts to the nonsense mediated decay mechanism (NMD), and provides functions for export of data to the GTF format for viewing in genome browsers, and a few plotting functions.
