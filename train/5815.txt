Cornerstone Core is a lightweight Javascript library for displaying medical image files in a web browser using HTML5 Canvas. Cornerstone is not restricted to a particular pixel container or transport mechanism, and does not define an interaction paradigm. As such, it may be adapted to any image format using an extensible image loader class, and can utilise present and future transport protocols and user interaction technique. The project is distributed as an open source Javascript library with a documented API, and a reference implementation which is also a working demonstration.
