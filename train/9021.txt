Marker2sequence (M2S) aims at mining quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for candidate genes. For each gene, within the QTL region, M2S uses data integration technology to integrate putative gene function with associated gene ontology terms, proteins, pathways and literature. As a typical QTL region easily contains several hundreds of genes, this gene list can then be further filtered using a keyword-based query on the aggregated annotations. M2S will help breeders to identify potential candidate genes for their traits of interest. Availability: Marker2sequence is freely accessible at
