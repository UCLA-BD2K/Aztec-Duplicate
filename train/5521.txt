SATURN is a cross-platform application for Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) analysis and visualization. It can compute and visualize scalar magnitudes derived from DTI data, perform tractography, perform automatic fiber clustering, perform glyph rendering, compute measures over regions of interest (ROIs) and along fiber tracts, and edit fibers and ROIs. It can also open and view scalar MRI volumes in DICOM and several other formats. SATURN is developed with the FLTK toolkit for full platform independence and a consistent user interface.
