The dks package consists of a set of diagnostic functions for multiple testing methods. The functions can be used to determine if the p-values produced by a multiple testing procedure are correct. These functions are designed to be applied to simulated data. The functions require the entire set of p-values from multiple simulated studies, so that the joint distribution can be evaluated.
