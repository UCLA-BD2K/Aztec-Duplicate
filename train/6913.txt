The HIV Drug Research Centre (HIVDRC) has established Web services for prediction of drug susceptibility for HIV proteases and reverse transcriptases. The services are based on two proteochemometric models which accepts a protease or reverse transcriptase sequence in amino acid form, and outputs the predicted drug susceptibility values. The predictions are based on a comprehensive analysis where all the relevant inhibitors are included, resulting in models with excellent predictive capabilities. Availability and Implementation: The services are implemented as interoperable Web services (REST and XMPP), with supporting web pages to allow for individual analyses. A set of plugins were also developed which make the services available from the Bioclipse workbench for life science. Services are available at http://www.hivdrc.org/services.
