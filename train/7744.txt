PatternLab provides tools for analyzing shotgun proteomic data quantitated by spectral counting (with DTASelect) or labeling (with Census). The modules provide means to point differentialy expressed proteins / peptides (ACFold / TFold modules), find proteins with simmilar expression profiles in time-course experiments (TrendQuest module), find unique proteins to a state (Area proportional venn diagram module) and help interpreting results according to the Gene Ontology (Gene Ontology Explorer module).
