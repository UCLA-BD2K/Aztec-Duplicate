Motivation: Approaches that use supervised machine learning techniques for proteinâprotein interaction (PPI) prediction typically use features obtained by integrating several sources of data. Often certain attributes of the data are not available, resulting in missing values. In particular, our hostâpathogen PPI datasets have a large fraction, in the range of 58â85% of missing values, which makes it challenging to apply machine learning algorithms. Results: We show that specialized techniques for missing value imputation can improve the performance of the models significantly. We use cross species information in combination with machine learning techniques like Group lasso with 1 / 2 regularization. We demonstrate the benefits of our approach on two PPI prediction problems. In our first example of Salmonellaâhuman PPI prediction, we are able to obtain high prediction accuracies with 77.6% precision and 84% recall. Comparison with various other techniques shows an improvement of 9 in F1 score over the next best technique. We also apply our method to Yersiniaâhuman PPI prediction successfully, demonstrating the generality of our approach. Availability: Predicted interactions, datasets, features are available at
