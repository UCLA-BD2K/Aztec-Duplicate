Circleator is a Perl application that generates circular figures of genome-associated data. It leverages BioPerl to support standard annotation and sequence file formats and produces publication quality SVG output. It is designed to be both flexible and easy to use. It includes a library of circular track types and predefined configuration files for common use-cases, including. (i) visualizing gene annotation and DNA sequence data from a GenBank flat file, (ii) displaying patterns of gene conservation in related microbial strains, (iii) showing Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) and indels relative to a reference genome and gene set and (iv) viewing RNA-Seq plots.
