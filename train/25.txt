BioModels Database is an annotated resource of quantitative models of biomedical interest. Models are carefully curated to verify their correspondence to their source articles. They are also extensively annotated, with (i) terms from controlled vocabularies, such as disease codes and Gene Ontology terms and (ii) links to other data resources, such as sequence or pathway databases. Researchers in the biomedical and life science communities can then search and retrieve models related to a particular disease, biological process or molecular complex.
