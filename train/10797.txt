Background: Genomic data production is at its highest level and continues to increase, making available novel primary data and existing public data to researchers for exploration. Here we explore the consequences of " batch " correction for biological discovery in two publicly available expression datasets. We consider this to include the estimation of and adjustment for widespread systematic heterogeneity in genomic measurements that is unrelated to the effects under study, whether it be technical or biological in nature. Methods: We present three illustrative data analyses using surrogate variable analysis (SVA) and describe how to perform artifact discovery in light of natural heterogeneity within biological groups, secondary biological questions of interest, and non-linear treatment effects in a dataset profiling differentiating pluripotent cells (GSE32923) and another from human brain tissue (GSE30272).
