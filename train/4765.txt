mkESA is an open source program for constructing enhanced suffix arrays (ESAs) from biological sequence data. The program is based on our implementation of Manzini's lightweight Deep-Shallow algorithm [1], which can also utilize multiple CPUs/cores for some extra speed-up. The generated output is compatible with the output of mkvtree from the Vmatch package written by Stefan Kurtz.
