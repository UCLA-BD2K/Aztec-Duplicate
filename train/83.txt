Summary: We present a significantly improved version of the flowType and RchyOptimyx BioConductor-based pipeline that is both 14 times faster and can accommodate multiple levels of biomarker expression for up to 96 markers. With these improvements, the pipeline is positioned to be an integral part of data analysis for high-throughput experiments on high-dimensional single-cell assay platforms, including flow cytometry, mass cytometry and single-cell RT-qPCR.
        Availability: FlowType and RchyOptimyx are distributed under the Artistic 2.0 license through Bioconductor.
