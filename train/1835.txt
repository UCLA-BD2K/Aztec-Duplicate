The NetSAM (Network Seriation and Modularization) package takes an edge-list representation of a network as an input, performs network seriation and modularization analysis, and generates as files that can be used as an input for the one-dimensional network visualization tool NetGestalt (http://www.netgestalt.org) or other network analysis.
