The R-package "fmri" provides functions for analyzing single run fmri data with structure adaptive smoothing procedure. This includes I/O function for ANALYZE, AFNI, or DICOM files, linear modelling with hemodynamic response functions, signal detection using Random Field Theory. Additionally, the structural adaptive segmentation method from Polzehl et al. 2010 is implemented.
