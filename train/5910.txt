MotiveValidator is a web-based application for the validation of ligands and residues stored using the PDB or PDBx/mmCIF format. It can evaluate whether the ligand or residue being studied has a correct annotation (3-letter code), i.e., if it has the same topology and stereochemistry as the model ligand or residue with this annotation.  Model structures are obtained from the wwPDB Chemical Components Dictionary. MotiveValidator can process thousands of ligands or residues in a single validation run that takes no more than a few minutes.
