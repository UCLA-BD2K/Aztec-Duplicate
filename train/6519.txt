BalestraWeb is an online server that allows users to instantly make predictions about the potential occurrence of interactions between any given drugâ€“target pair, or predict the most likely interaction partners of any drug or target listed in the DrugBank. It also permits users to identify most similar drugs or most similar targets based on their interaction patterns. Outputs help to develop hypotheses about drug repurposing as well as potential side effects. Availability and implementation: BalestraWeb is accessible at http:// balestra.csb.pitt.edu/. The tool is built using a probabilistic matrix fac-torization method and DrugBank v3, and the latent variable models are trained using the GraphLab collaborative filtering toolkit. The server is implemented using Python, Flask, NumPy and SciPy.
