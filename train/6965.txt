Despite a growing interest in a correlation between copy number variations (CNVs) and flanking single nucleotide polymorph-isms, few databases provide such information. In particular, most information on CNV available so far was obtained in Caucasian and Yoruba populations, and little is known about CNV in Asian populations. This article presents a database that provides CNV regions tagged by single nucleotide polymorphisms in about 4700 Koreans, which were detected under strict quality control, manually curated and experimentally validated.
