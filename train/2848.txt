Phospho3D is a database of three-dimensional structures of phosphorylation sites which stores information retrieved from the Phospho.ELM database and which is enriched with structural information and annotations at the residue level. The database also collects the results of a large-scale structural comparison procedure providing clues for the identification of new putative phosphorylation sites.
