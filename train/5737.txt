MyVariant.info provides simple-to-use REST web services to query/retrieve variant annotation data, aggregated from many popular data resources. Itâ€™s designed with simplicity and performance emphasized. You can use use it to annotate discovered variants with the up-to-date variant annotation; or query for specific known variants using a combination of your query criteria, especially across multiple data resources (e.g. to get all variants on gene CDK2, having polyphen2 score  0.99, and also found in cosmic database using this query). MyVariant.info can also be used to power a web application which requires querying or retrieving variant annotations, without the need of maintaining your own local database backend.
