SELAM is a forward time population genetic simulation program that provides a flexible framework for simulating admixture between any number of ancestral populations. The program can be used to simulate complex demographic and selection models, including dioecious or mon-oecious populations, autosomal or sex chromosomes, local adaptation, dominance, epistasis, and mate choice. Availability and Implementation: The SELAM package (C Ã¾Ã¾ source code, examples and manuals) is available via github at https://github.com/russcd/SELAM. This package is distributed under version 3 of the GNU general public license.
