CATH is a hierarchical classification of protein domain structures, which clusters proteins at four major levels: Class (C), Architecture (A), Topology (T) and Homologous superfamily (H). The boundaries and assignments for each protein domain are determined using a combination of automated and manual procedures which include computational techniques, empirical and statistical evidence, literature review and expert analysis.
