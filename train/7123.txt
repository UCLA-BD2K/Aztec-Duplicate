Motivation: Pairwise local alignment is an indispensable tool for molecular biologists. In real time (i.e. in about 1 s), ALP (Ascending Ladder Program) calculates the E-values for protein–protein or DNA–DNA local alignments of random sequences, for arbitrary substitution score matrix, gap costs and letter abundances; and FALP (Frameshift Ascending Ladder Program) performs a similar task, although more slowly, for frameshifting DNA-protein alignments. Availability and implementation: To permit other Cþþ programmers to implement the computational efficiencies in ALP and FALP directly within their own programs, Cþþ source codes are available in the public domain at http://go.usa.gov/3GTSW under 'ALP' and 'FALP', along with the standalone programs ALP and FALP.
