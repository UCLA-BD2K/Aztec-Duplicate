Summary: Mutational signatures are patterns in the occurrence of somatic single-nucleotide variants that can reflect underlying mutational processes. The SomaticSignatures package provides flexible, interoperable and easy-to-use tools that identify such signatures in cancer sequencing data. It facilitates large-scale, cross-dataset estimation of mutational signatures, implements existing methods for pattern decomposition, supports extension through user-defined approaches and integrates with existing Bioconductor workflows.
        Availability and implementation: The R package SomaticSignatures is available as part of the Bioconductor project. Its documentation provides additional details on the methods and demonstrates applications to biological datasets.
