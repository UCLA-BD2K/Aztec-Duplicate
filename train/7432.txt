Motivation: Kablammo is a web-based application that produces interactive, vector-based visual-izations of sequence alignments generated by BLAST. These visualizations can illustrate many features , including shared protein domains, chromosome structural modifications and genome misassembly. Availability and implementation: Kablammo can be used at http://kablammo.wasmuthlab.org. For a local installation, the source code and instructions are available under the MIT license at http://
