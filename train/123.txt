cpgplot identifies CpG islands in one or more nucleotide sequences. The ratio of observed to expected number of GC dinucleotides patterns is calculated over a window (sequence region) which is moved along the sequence. The calculated ratios are plotted graphically, together with the regions which match this program's definition of a "CpG island" (a CG dinucleotide rich area). A report file is written giving the input sequence name, CpG island parameters and data on any CpG islands that are found.
