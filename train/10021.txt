PanViz is a novel, interactive, visualization tool for pangenome analysis. PanViz allows visualization of changes in gene group (groups of similar genes across genomes) classification as different subsets of pangenomes are selected, as well as comparisons of individual genomes to pangenomes with gene ontology based navigation of gene groups. Furthermore it allows for rich and complex visual querying of gene groups in the pangenome. PanViz visualizations require no external programs and are easily sharable, allowing for rapid pangenome analyses. Availability and Implementation: PanViz is written entirely in JavaScript and is available on https:// github.com/thomasp85/PanViz. A companion R package that facilitates the creation of PanViz visu-alizations from a range of data formats is released through Bioconductor and is available at https:// bioconductor.org/packages/PanVizGenerator.
