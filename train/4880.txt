MEDIPS was developed for analyzing data derived from methylated DNA immunoprecipitation (MeDIP) experiments followed by sequencing (MeDIP-seq). However, MEDIPS provides functionalities for the analysis of any kind of quantitative sequencing data (e.g. ChIP-seq, MBD-seq, CMS-seq and others) including calculation of differential coverage between groups of samples and saturation and correlation analysis.
