This package implements several functions useful for analysis of gene expression data by sequencing tags as done in SAGE (Serial Analysis of Gene Expressen) data, i.e. extraction of a SAGE library from sequence files, sequence error correction, library comparison. Sequencing error correction is implementing using an Expectation Maximization Algorithm based on a Mixture Model of tag counts.
