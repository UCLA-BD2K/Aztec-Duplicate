Analysis of the composition of heterogeneous tissue has been greatly enabled by recent developments in single-cell transcriptomics. We present SCell, an integrated software tool for quality filtering, normalization, feature selection, iterative dimensionality reduction, clustering and the estimation of gene-expression gradients from large ensembles of single-cell RNA-seq datasets. SCell is open source, and implemented with an intuitive graphical interface. Scripts and protocols for the high-throughput pre-processing of large ensembles of single-cell, RNA-seq datasets are provided as an additional resource. Availability and Implementation: Binary executables for Windows, MacOS and Linux are available at
