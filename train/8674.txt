Motivation: Gene set analysis has revolutionized the interpretation of high-throughput transcrip-tomic data. Nowadays, with comprehensive studies that measure multiple-omics from the same sample, powerful tools for the integrative analysis of multi-omics datasets are required. Results: Here, we present GeneTrail2, a web service allowing the integrated analysis of transcrip-tomic, miRNomic, genomic and proteomic datasets. It offers multiple statistical tests, a large number of predefined reference sets, as well as a comprehensive collection of biological categories and enables direct comparisons between the computed results. We used GeneTrail2 to explore patho-genic mechanisms of Wilms tumors. We not only succeeded in revealing signaling cascades that may contribute to the malignancy of blastemal subtype tumors but also identified potential bio-markers for nephroblastoma with adverse prognosis. The presented use-case demonstrates that GeneTrail2 is well equipped for the integrative analysis of comprehensive-omics data and may help to shed light on complex pathogenic mechanisms in cancer and other diseases.
