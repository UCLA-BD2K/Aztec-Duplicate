Biological insights can be obtained through computational integration of genomics data sets consisting of diverse types of information. The integration is often hampered by a large variety of existing file formats, often containing similar information, and the necessity to use complicated tools to achieve the desired results. We have built an R package, genomation, to expedite the extraction of biological information from high throughput data. The package works with a variety of genomic interval file types and enables easy summarization and annotation of high throughput data sets with given genomic annotations. Availability and implementation: The software is currently distributed under MIT artistic license and freely available at http://bioinformatics.mdc-berlin.de/genomation, and through the Bioconductor framework.
