Motivation: Fluorescence Correlation Spectroscopy (FCS) is a popular tool for measuring molecular mobility and how mobility relates to molecular interaction dynamics and bioactivity in living cells. The FCS technique has been significantly advanced by its combination with super-resolution STED microscopy (STED-FCS). Specifically, the use of gated detection has shown great potential for enhancing STED-FCS, but has also created a demand for software which is efficient and also implements the latest algorithms. Prior to this study, no open software has been available which would allow practical time-gating and correlation of point data derived from STED-FCS experiments.
