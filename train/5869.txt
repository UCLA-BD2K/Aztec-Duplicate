Robust estimation of cDNA microarray intensities with replicates. The package uses a Bayesian hierarchical model for the robust estimation. Outliers are modeled explicitly using a t-distribution, and the model also addresses classical issues such as design effects, normalization, transformation, and nonconstant variance.
