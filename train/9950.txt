The NCI-60 human tumor cell line panel is an invaluable resource for cancer researchers , providing drug sensitivity, molecular and phenotypic data for a range of cancer types. CellMiner is a web resource that provides tools for the acquisition and analysis of quality-controlled NCI-60 data. CellMiner supports queries of up to 150 drugs or genes, but the output is an Excel file for each drug or gene. This output format makes it difficult for researchers to explore the data from large queries. CellMiner Companion is a web application that facilitates the exploration and visual-ization of output from CellMiner, further increasing the accessibility of NCI-60 data. Availability and Implementation: The web application is freely accessible at https://pul-bioinfor matics.shinyapps.io/CellMinerCompanion. The R source code can be downloaded at https://github. com/pepascuzzi/CellMinerCompanion.git.
