Motivation: Most biological processes are mediated by the proteinâ protein interactions. Determination of the proteinâprotein structures and insight into their interactions are vital to understand the mechanisms of protein functions. Currently, compared with the isolated protein structures, only a small fraction of proteinâprotein structures are experimentally solved. Therefore, the computational docking methods play an increasing role in predicting the structures and interactions of proteinâprotein complexes. The scoring function of proteinâprotein interactions is the key responsible for the accuracy of the computational docking. Previous scoring functions were mostly developed by optimizing the binding affinity which determines the stability of the proteinâprotein complex, but they are often lack of the consideration of specificity which determines the discrimination of native proteinâ protein complex against competitive ones. Results: We developed a scoring function (named as SPA-PP, spe-cificity and affinity of the proteinâprotein interactions) by incorporating both the specificity and affinity into the optimization strategy. The testing results and comparisons with other scoring functions show that SPA-PP performs remarkably on both predictions of binding pose and binding affinity. Thus, SPA-PP is a promising quantification of proteinâprotein interactions, which can be implemented into the protein docking tools and applied for the predictions of proteinâprotein structure and affinity.
