Affinity propagation (AP) clustering has recently gained increasing popularity in bioinformatics. AP clustering has the advantage that it allows for determining typical cluster members, the so-called exemplars. We provide an R implementation of this promising new clustering technique to account for the ubiquity of R in bioinformatics. This article introduces the package and presents an application from structural biology. Availability: The R package apcluster is available via CRANâThe Comprehensive R Archive Network: http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/apcluster Contact
