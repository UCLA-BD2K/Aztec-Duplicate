Motivation: Caspases and granzyme B (GrB) are important proteases involved in fundamental cellular processes and play essential roles in programmed cell death, necrosis and inflammation. Although a number of substrates for both types have been experimentally identified, the complete repertoire of caspases and granzyme B substrates remained to be fully characterized. Accordingly, systematic bioinformatics studies of known cleavage sites may provide important insights into their sub-strate specificity and facilitate the discovery of novel substrates. Results: We develop a new bioinformatics tool, termed Cascleave 2.0, which builds on previous success of the Cascleave tool for predicting generic caspase cleavage sites. It can be efficiently used to predict potential caspase-specific cleavage sites for the human cas-pase-1, 3, 6, 7, 8 and GrB. In particular, we integrate heterogeneous sequence and protein functional information from various sources to improve the prediction accuracy of Cascleave 2.0. During classification , we use both maximum relevance minimum redundancy and forward feature selection techniques to quantify the relative contribution of each feature to prediction and thus remove redundant as well as irrelevant features. A systematic evaluation of Cascleave 2.0 using the benchmark data and comparison with other state-of-the-art tools using independent test data indicate that Cascleave 2.0 outperforms other tools on protease-specific cleavage site prediction of caspase-1, 3, 6, 7 and GrB. Cascleave 2.0 is anticipated to be used as a powerful tool for identifying novel substrates and cleavage sites of caspases and GrB and help understand the functional roles of these important proteases in human proteolytic cascades.
