MamPhEA is a web application dedicated to understanding functional properties of mammalian gene sets based on mouse-mutant phenotypes. It allows users to conduct enrichment analysis on predefined or user-defined phenotypes, gives users the option to specify phenotypes derived from null mutations, produces easily comprehensible results and supports analyses on genes of all mammalian species with a fully sequenced genome.
