Eukaryotic gene expression is regulated both at the transcription and the mRNA degradation levels. The implementation of functional genomics methods that allow the simultaneous measurement of transcription (TR) and degradation (DR) rates for thousands of mRNAs is a huge improvement in this field. One of the best established methods for mRNA stability determination is genomic run-on (GRO). It allows the measurement of DR, TR and mRNA levels during cell dynamic responses. Here, we offer a software package that provides improved algorithms for determination of mRNA stability during dynamic GRO experiments.
