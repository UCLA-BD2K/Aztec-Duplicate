ChemMapper is an online platform to predict polypharma-cology effect and mode of action for small molecules based on 3D similarity computation. ChemMapper collects 4350 000 chemical structures with bioactivities and associated target annotations (as well as 43 000 000 non-annotated compounds for virtual screening). Taking the user-provided chemical structure as the query, the top most similar compounds in terms of 3D similarity are returned with associated pharmacology annotations. ChemMapper is designed to provide versatile services in a variety of chemogenomics, drug repur-posing, polypharmacology, novel bioactive compounds identification and scaffold hopping studies.
