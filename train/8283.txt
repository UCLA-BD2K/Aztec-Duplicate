A large number of proteins function as homo-oligomers; therefore, predicting homo-oligomeric structure of proteins is of primary importance for understanding protein function at the molecular level. Here, we introduce a web server for prediction of protein homo-oligomer structure. The server takes a protein monomer structure as input and predicts its homo-oligomer structure from oligomer templates selected based on sequence and tertiary/quaternary structure similarity. Using protein model structures as input, the server shows clear improvement over the best methods of CASP9 in predicting oligomeric structures from amino acid sequences.
