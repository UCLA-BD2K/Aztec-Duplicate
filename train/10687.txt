Motivation: Novel technologies can generate large sets of short double-stranded DNA sequences that can be used to measure their regulatory effects. Microarrays can measure in vitro the binding intensity of a protein to thousands of probes. Synthetic enhancer sequences inserted into an organism's genome allow us to measure in vivo the effect of such sequences on the phenotype. In both applications , by using sequence probes that cover all k-mers, a comprehensive picture of the effect of all possible short sequences on gene regulation is obtained. The value of k that can be used in practice is, however, severely limited by cost and space considerations. A key challenge is, therefore, to cover all k-mers with a minimal number of probes. The standard way to do this uses the de Bruijn sequence of length 4 k. However, as probes are double stranded, when a k-mer is included in a probe, its reverse complement k-mer is accounted for as well. Results: Here, we show how to efficiently create a shortest possible sequence with the property that it contains each k-mer or its reverse complement, but not necessarily both. The length of the resulting sequence approaches half that of the de Bruijn sequence as k increases resulting in a more efficient array, which allows covering more longer sequences; alternatively, additional sequences with redundant k-mers of interest can be added.
