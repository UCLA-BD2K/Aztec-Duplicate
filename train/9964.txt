Motivation: The enzyme nomenclature system, commonly known as the enzyme commission (EC) number, plays a key role in classifying and predicting enzymatic reactions. However, numerous reactions have been described in various pathways that do not have an official EC number, and the reactions are not expected to have an EC number assigned because of a lack of articles published on enzyme assays. To predict the EC number of a non-classified enzymatic reaction, we focus on the structural similarity of its substrate and product to the substrate and product of reactions that have been classified. Results: We propose a new method to assign EC numbers using a maximum common substructure algorithm, mutual information and a support vector machine, termed the Enzyme COmmission numbers Handler (ECOH). A jack-knife test shows that the sensitivity, precision and accuracy of the method in predicting the first three digits of the official EC number (i.e. the EC sub-subclass) are 86.1%, 87.4% and 99.8%, respectively. We furthermore demonstrate that, by examining the ranking in the candidate lists of EC sub-subclasses generated by the algorithm, the method can successfully predict the classification of 85 enzymatic reactions that fall into multiple EC sub-subclasses. The better performance of the ECOH as compared with existing methods and its flexibility in predicting EC numbers make it useful for predicting enzyme function.
