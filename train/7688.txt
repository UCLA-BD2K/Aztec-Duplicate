Identification of metabolites using high-resolution multi-stage mass spectrometry (MS n) data is a significant challenge demanding access to all sorts of computational infrastructures. MetiTree is a user-friendly, web application dedicated to organize, process, share, visualize and compare MS n data. It integrates several features to export and visualize complex MS n data, facilitating the exploration and interpretation of metabolomics experiments. A dedicated spectral tree viewer allows the simultaneous presentation of three related types of MS n data, namely, the spectral data, the fragmentation tree and the fragmentation reactions. MetiTree stores the data in an internal database to enable searching for similar fragmentation trees and matching against other MS n data. As such MetiTree contains much functionality that will make the difficult task of identifying unknown metabolites much easier. Availability: MetiTree is accessible at
