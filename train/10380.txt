Motivation: Gene clusters are arrangements of functionally related genes on a chromosome. In bacteria, it is expected that evolutionary pressures would conserve these arrangements due to the functional advantages they provide. Visualization of conserved gene clusters across multiple genomes provides key insights into their evolutionary histories. Therefore, a software tool that enables visualization and functional analyses of gene clusters would be a great asset to the biological research community. Results: We have developed GeneclusterViz, a Java-based tool that allows for the visualization, exploration and downstream analyses of conserved gene clusters across multiple genomes. GeneclusterViz combines an easy-to-use exploration interface for gene clusters with a host of other analysis features such as multiple sequence alignments, phylogenetic analyses and integration with the KEGG pathway database.
