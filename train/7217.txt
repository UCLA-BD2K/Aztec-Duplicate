Correlated mutations constitute a fundamental idea in evolutionary biology, and understanding correlated mutations will, in turn, facilitate an understanding of the genetic mechanisms governing evolution. CorMut is an R package designed to compute correlated mutations in the unit of codon or amino acid mutation. Three classical methods were incorporated, and the computation results can be represented as correlation mutation networks. CorMut also enables the comparison of correlated mutations between two different evolutionary conditions.
