Many applications in genetics require haplotype reconstruction. We present a phasing program designed for large half-sibs families (as observed in plant and animals) that is robust to genotyping and map errors. We demonstrate that it is more efficient than previous versions and other programs, particularly in the presence of genotyping errors. Availability and implementation: The software LINKPHASE3 is included in the PHASEBOOK package and can be freely downloaded from www.giga.ulg.ac.be/jcms/prod_381171/software. The package is written in FORTRAN and contains source codes. A manual is provided with the package.
