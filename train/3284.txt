Gene-centric map of the genome structure, coding sequences, and identified allelic variation in genes being targeted for a role in disease susceptibility by the NIEHS (National Institute of Evironmental Health Sciences). This database provides a graphical view of all available SNP data including allele frequencies and genotypes in select populations. This information is key in selecting the polymorphic sites needed to examine disease risk in human population studies.
