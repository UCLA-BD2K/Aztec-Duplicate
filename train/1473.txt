Functions to perform the non-parametric and parametric CAnD tests on a set of ancestry proportions. For a particular ancestral subpopulation, a user will supply the estimated ancestry proportion for each sample, and each chromosome or chromosomal segment of interest. A p-value for each chromosome as well as an overall CAnD p-value will be returned for each test. Plotting functions are also available.
