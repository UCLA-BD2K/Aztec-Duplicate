We report the creation of Drug Signatures Database (DSigDB), a new gene set resource that relates drugs/compounds and their target genes, for gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA). DSigDB currently holds 22 527 gene sets, consists of 17 389 unique compounds covering 19 531 genes. We also developed an online DSigDB resource that allows users to search, view and down-load drugs/compounds and gene sets. DSigDB gene sets provide seamless integration to GSEA software for linking gene expressions with drugs/compounds for drug repurposing and transla-tional research. Availability and implementation: DSigDB is freely available for non-commercial use at http://tan lab.ucdenver.edu/DSigDB.
