XiP (eXtensible integrative Pipeline) is a flexible, editable and modular environment with a user-friendly interface that does not require previous advanced programming skills to run, construct and edit workflows. XiP allows the construction of workflows by linking components written in both R and Java, the analysis of high-throughput data in grid engine systems and also the development of customized pipelines that can be encapsulated in a package and distributed. XiP already comes with several ready-to-use pipeline flows for the most common genomic and transcriptomic analysis and 300 computational components.
