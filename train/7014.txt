SWEEPFINDER is a widely used program that implements a powerful likelihood-based method for detecting recent positive selection, or selective sweeps. Here, we present SWEEPFINDER2, an extension of SWEEPFINDER with increased sensitivity and robustness to the confounding effects of mutation rate variation and background selection. Moreover, SWEEPFINDER2 has increased flexibility that enables the user to specify test sites, set the distance between test sites and utilize a recombin-ation map. Availability and implementation: SWEEPFINDER2 is a freely-available (www.personal.psu.edu/mxd60/ sf2.html) software package that is written in C and can be run from a Unix command line.
