A data-driven test for the assumptions of quantile normalization using raw data such as objects that inherit eSets (e.g. ExpressionSet, MethylSet). Group level information about each sample (such as Tumor / Normal status) must also be provided because the test assesses if there are global differences in the distributions between the user-defined groups.
