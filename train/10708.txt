Increased emphasis on reproducibility of published research in the last few years has led to the large-scale archiving of sequencing data. While this data can, in theory, be used to reproduce results in papers, it is difficult to use in practice. We introduce a series of tools for processing and analyzing RNA-Seq data in the Sequence Read Archive, that together have allowed us to build an easily extendable resource for analysis of data underlying published papers. Our system makes the exploration of data easily accessible and usable without technical expertise. Our database and associated tools can be accessed at The Lair: http://pachterlab.github.io/lair.
