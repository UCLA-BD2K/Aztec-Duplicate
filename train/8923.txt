Although in silico drug discovery approaches are crucial for the development of pharmaceuticals, their potential advantages in agrochemical industry have not been realized. The challenge for computer-aided methods in agrochemical arena is a lack of sufficient information for both pesticides and their targets. Therefore, it is important to establish such knowledge repertoire that contains comprehensive pesticides' profiles, which include physicochemical properties , environmental fates, toxicities and mode of actions. Here, we present an integrated platform called Pesticide-Target interaction database (PTID), which comprises a total of 1347 pesticides with rich annotation of ecotoxicological and toxicological data as well as 13 738 interactions of pesticide-target and 4245 protein terms via text mining. Additionally, through the integration of ChemMapper, an in-house computational approach to polypharmacology, PTID can be used as a computational platform to identify pesticides targets and design novel agrochemical products.
