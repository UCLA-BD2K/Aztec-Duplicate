The BD2K-LINCS DCIC Portal (LINCSPort) provides a unified interface for access to all LINCS data, signatures, analysis tools and other resources.  LINCS dataset packages and reagents are described using the LINCS metadata standards.  LINCSPort enables download of complete LINCS dataset packages and associated metadata.  It is a web-based and responsively designed interface to be accessed by a wide range of devices.  LINCSPort is integrated with the MetaData Registry and interfaces with other components of the BD2K-LINCS Integrated Knowledge Environment (IKE).
