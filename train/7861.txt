GO-Module is a web-accessible synthesis and visualization tool developed for end-user biologists to greatly simplify the interpretation of prioritized Gene Ontology (GO) terms. GO-Module radically reduces the complexity of raw GO results into compact biomodules in two distinct ways, by (i) constructing biomodules from significant GO terms based on hierarchical knowledge, and (ii) refining the GO terms in each biomodule to contain only true positive results. Altogether, the features (biomodules) of GO-Module outputs are better organized and on average four times smaller than the input GO terms list (P = 0.0005, n = 16).
