Motivation: Cancer researchers seeking immunotherapy targets in cancer cells need tools to locate highly expressed proteins unique to cancer cells. Missense mutation and frameshift location reporter (MMuFLR), a Galaxy-based workflow, analyzes next-generation sequencing paired read RNA-seq output to reliably identify small frameshift mutations and missense mutations in highly expressed protein coding genes. MMuFLR ignores known SNPs, low quality reads and poly-A/T sequences. For each frameshift and missense mutation identified, MMuFLR provides the location and sequence of the amino acid substitutions in the novel protein candidates for direct input into epitope evaluation tools.
