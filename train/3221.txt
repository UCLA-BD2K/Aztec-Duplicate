The IRESite presents experimental evidence of many eukaryotic viral and cellular internal ribosome entry site (IRES) regions. The IRESite gradually evolved into a robust tool providing biologically meaningful information regarding the IRESs and their experimental background (including annotation of IRES secondary structures and IRES trans-acting factors) as well as thorough concluding remarks to stored database entries and regularly updated evaluation of the reported IRES function.
