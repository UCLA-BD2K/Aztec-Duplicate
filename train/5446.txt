This testing service is a simple MTOM service that allows file upload, listing of files and file download. The service implementation has a clever mechanism that stores incoming and outgoing attachments on the hard drive without loading it into memory. This should allow for very large transfers. 

The service is supposed to work with any SOAP stack that supports MTOM. There is a generic SOAP client available that can communicate with the service called soapUI (www.soapui.org). This client program works but it seems to have limitations on the file size when I have tested it, most likely due to loading the attachment into memory before sending it. Other client technologies also exist.

The service is installed on a development server, so please feel free to test it with large files (max 7 GB).
