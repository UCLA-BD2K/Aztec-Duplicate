Background: Next-generation sequencing datasets are becoming more frequent, and their use in population studies is becoming widespread. For non-model species, without a reference genome, it is possible from a panel of individuals to identify a set of SNPs that can be used for further population genotyping. However the lack of a reference genome to which the sequenced data could be compared makes the finding of SNPs more troublesome. Additionally when the data sources (strains) are not identified (e.g. in datasets of pooled individuals), the problem of finding reliable variation in these datasets can become much more difficult due to the lack of specialized software for this specific task.
