This package uses non-parametric methods to detect rhythms in time series. It deals with outliers, missing values and is optimized for time series comprising 10-100 measurements. As it does not assume expect any distinct waveform it is optimal or detecting oscillating behavior (e.g. circadian or cell cycle) in e.g. genome- or proteome-wide biological measurements such as: micro arrays, proteome mass spectrometry, or metabolome measurements.
