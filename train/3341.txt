Dolce presents database of DNA structure motives based on automatic classification method consisting of the combination of supervised and unsupervised approaches. This workflow has been applied to analyze 816 X-ray and 664 NMR DNA structures released till February 2013. Dinucleotides with unassigned conformations are either classified into one of already known 24 classes or into one of six new classes among so far unclassifiable data, which were newly identified and annotated among X-ray structures by authors of this tool.
