CytoModeler is an open-source Java application based on the Cytoscape platform. It integrates large-scale network analysis and quantitative modeling by combining omics analysis on the Cytoscape platform, access to deterministic and stochastic simulators, and static and dynamic network context visualizations of simulation results. Availability: Implemented in Java, CytoModeler runs with Cytoscape 2.6 and 2.7. Binaries, documentation and video walkthroughs are freely available at http://vrac.iastate.edu/~jlv/ cytomodeler/.
