Simulation programs based on the coalescent efficiently generate genetic data according to a given model of evolution. We present coala, an R package for calling coalescent simulators with a unified syntax. It can execute simulations with several programs, calculate additional summary statistics and combine multiple simulations to create biologically more realistic data. Availability and implementation: The package is publicly available on CRAN and on https://github. com/statgenlmu/coala under the conditions of the MIT license.
