It is now easy and increasingly usual to produce oriented RNA-Seq data as a prokaryotic genome is being sequenced. However, this information is usually just used for expression quantifi-cation. EuGene-PP is a fully automated pipeline for structural annotation of prokaryotic genomes integrating protein similarities, statistical information and any oriented expression information (RNA-Seq or tiling arrays) through a variety of file formats to produce a qualitatively enriched annotation including coding regions but also (possibly anti-sense) non-coding genes and transcription start sites. Availability and implementation: EuGene-PP is an open-source software based on EuGene-P integrating a Galaxy
