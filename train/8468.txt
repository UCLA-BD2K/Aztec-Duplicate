Genome editing with programmable nucleases has been widely adopted in research and medicine. Next generation sequencing (NGS) platforms are now widely used for measuring the frequencies of mutations induced by CRISPR-Cas9 and other programmable nucleases. Here, we present an online tool, Cas-Analyzer, a JavaScript-based implementation for NGS data analysis. Because Cas-Analyzer is completely used at a client-side web browser on-the-fly, there is no need to upload very large NGS datasets to a server, a time-consuming step in genome editing analysis. Currently , Cas-Analyzer supports various programmable nucleases, including single nucleases and paired nucleases. Availability: Free access at http://www.rgenome.net/cas-analyzer/. Contact
