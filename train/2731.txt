JEPETTO (Java Enrichment of Pathways Extended To TOpology) is a Cytoscape 3.x plugin performing integrative human gene set analysis. It identifies functional associations between genes and known cellular pathways, and processes using protein interaction networks and topological analysis. The plugin integrates information from three separate web servers we published previously, specializing in enrichment analysis, pathways expansion and topological matching. This integration substantially simplifies the analysis of user gene sets and the interpretation of the results. We demonstrate the utility of the JEPETTO plugin on a set of misregulated genes associated with Alzheimer's disease.

Installable directly via Cytoscape plugin manager. Released under the GNU General Public Licence.
