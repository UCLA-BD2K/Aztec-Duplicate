Motivation: Sequencing glycan structures is a difficult problem that requires the use of multiple experimental approaches. One powerful approach to glycan sequencing is the combination of liquid chromatography with sequential exoglycosidase digestions; however, interpreting this can be difficult and time-consuming. To aid this process, we introduce GlycoProfileAssigner, software for automated structural assignment of glycan profile data from liquid chromatography experiments. Results: GlycoProfileAssigner has been tested on human IgG data, and can retrieve the correct structure in 14 out of 16 peaks tested. Availability and Implementation: The programme and its source code is available at https:// bitbucket.org/fergaljd/glycoprofileassigner
