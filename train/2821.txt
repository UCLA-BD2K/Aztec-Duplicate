TopologyGSA is a novel approach to perform pathway analysis using gene expression data. Given the structure of a graph (a pathway) TopologyGSA introduces two statistical tests to compare the mean and the concentration matrices between two groups. Specifically, these tests can be performed on the graph and on its connected components (cliques).
