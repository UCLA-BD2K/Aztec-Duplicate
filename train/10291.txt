SiteBinder is a software for fast and accurate superimposition of protein fragments. It can process thousands of fragments in few seconds, it provides also an average structure and it searches for the best pairing among fragments. It offers two approaches for matching of fragments: A combinatorial approach (searches for an otimal pairing between atoms from superimposed molecules) and a subgraph matching approach (faster, able to manage different sized fragments but it can miss the optimal pairing).
