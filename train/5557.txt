annmap provides annotation mappings for Affymetrix exon arrays and coordinate based queries to support deep sequencing data analysis. Database access is hidden behind the API which provides a set of functions such as genesInRange(), geneToExon(), exonDetails(), etc. Functions to plot gene architecture and BAM file data are also provided. Underlying data are from Ensembl.
