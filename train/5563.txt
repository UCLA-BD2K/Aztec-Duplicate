Catalog of eukaryotic orthologous protein-coding genes. OrthoDB explicitly delineates orthologs at each radiation along the species phylogeny. Available protein descriptors, together with Gene Ontology and InterPro attributes, serve to provide general descriptive annotations of the orthologous groups, and facilitate comprehensive database querying. Data sources include proteomes from arthropods, fungi, vertebrates and basal metazoans.
