Protein interaction network-based pathway analysis (PINBPA) for genome-wide association studies (GWAS) has been developed as a Cytoscape app, to enable analysis of GWAS data in a network fashion. Users can easily import GWAS summary-level data, draw Manhattan plots, define blocks, prioritize genes with random walk with restart, detect enriched subnetworks and test the significance of subnetworks via a user-friendly interface.
