Velvet is a de novo genomic assembler specially designed for short read sequencing technologies. Velvet currently takes in short read sequences, removes errors then produces high quality unique contigs. It then uses paired-end read and long read information, when available, to retrieve the repeated areas between contigs.  Velvet is now multithreaded, thanks to the use of the OMP library.
