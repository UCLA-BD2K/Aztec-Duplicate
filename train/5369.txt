Detection of distant homology is a widely used computational approach for studying protein evolution, structure and function. Here, we report a homology search web server based on sequence profileâprofile comparison. The user may perform searches in one of several regularly updated profile databases using either a single sequence or a multiple sequence alignment as an input. The same profile databases can also be downloaded for local use. The capabilities of the server are illustrated with the identification of new members of the highly diverse PD-(D/E)XK nuclease superfamily.
