We introduce here a novel acquisition and processing methodology for cross-polarization based 1D rotating-frame relaxation dispersion NMR experiments. This easy-to-use protocol greatly facilitates the screening, acquisition, processing and model fitting of large on-and off-resonance R 1q relaxation dispersion NMR datasets in an automated manner for the analysis of chemical exchange phenomena in biomolecules. Availability and Implementation: The Amaterasu package including the spreadsheet, Bruker pulse programs and analysis software is available at
