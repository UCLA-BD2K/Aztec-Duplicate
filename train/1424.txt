This library contains functions that calculate various statistics of differential expression for microarray data, including t statistics, fold change, F statistics, SAM, moderated t and F statistics and B statistics. It also implements a new methodology called DEDS (Differential Expression via Distance Summary), which selects differentially expressed genes by integrating and summarizing a set of statistics using a weighted distance approach.
