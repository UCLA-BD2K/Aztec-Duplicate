timeClip is a topology based pathway analysis specifically tailored to long time series without replicates. timeClip combines dimension reduction techniques and graph decomposition theory to explore and identify the portion of pathways that is most time-dependent. In the first step, timeClip selects the time-dependent pathways; in the second step, the most time dependent portions of these pathways are highlighted.
