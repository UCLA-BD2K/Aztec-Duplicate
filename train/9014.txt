Motivation: Sequence homology searches are used in various fields. New sequencing technologies produce huge amounts of sequence data, which continuously increase the size of sequence databases. As a result, homology searches require large amounts of computational time, especially for metagenomic analysis. Results: We developed a fast homology search method based on database subsequence clustering , and implemented it as GHOSTZ. This method clusters similar subsequences from a database to perform an efficient seed search and ungapped extension by reducing alignment candidates based on triangle inequality. The database subsequence clustering technique achieved an $2-fold increase in speed without a large decrease in search sensitivity. When we measured with metage-nomic data, GHOSTZ is $2.2â2.8 times faster than RAPSearch and is $185â261 times faster than BLASTX.
