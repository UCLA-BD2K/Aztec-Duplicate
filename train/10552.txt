The GHap R package was designed to call haplotypes from phased marker data. Given user-defined haplotype blocks (HapBlock), the package identifies the different haplotype alleles (HapAllele) present in the data and scores sample haplotype allele genotypes (HapGenotype) based on HapAllele dose (i.e. 0, 1 or 2 copies). The output is not only useful for analyses that can handle multi-allelic markers, but is also conveniently formatted for existing pipelines intended for bi-allelic markers.
