Motivation: Metabolic reaction maps allow visualization of genome-scale models and high-throughput data in a format familiar to many biologists. However, creating a map of a large metabolic model is a difficult and time-consuming process. MetDraw fully automates the map-drawing process for metabolic models containing hundreds to thousands of reactions. MetDraw can also overlay high-throughput 'omics' data directly on the generated maps. Availability and implementation: Web interface and source code are freely available at
