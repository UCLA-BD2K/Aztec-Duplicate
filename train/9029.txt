Motivation: Molecular dynamics simulations provide atomic insight into the physicochemical characteristics of lipid membranes and hence, a wide range of force field families capable of modelling various lipid types have been developed in recent years. To model membranes in a biologically realistic lipid composition, simulation systems containing multiple different lipids must be assembled. Results: We present a new web service called MemGen that is capable of setting up simulation systems of heterogenous lipid membranes. MemGen is not restricted to certain lipid force fields or lipid types, but instead builds membranes from uploaded structure files which may contain any kind of amphiphilic molecule. MemGen works with any all-atom or united-atom lipid representation. Availability and implementation: MemGen is freely available without registration at http://memgen.
