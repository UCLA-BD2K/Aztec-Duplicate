Motivation: Recent advances in flow cytometry enable simultaneous single-cell measurement of 30þ surface and intracellular proteins. CytoSPADE is a high-performance implementation of an interface for the Spanning-tree Progression Analysis of Density-normalized Events algorithm for tree-based analysis and visualization of this high-dimensional cytometry data. Availability: Source code and binaries are freely available at http:// cytospade.org and via Bioconductor version 2.10 onwards for Linux, OSX and Windows. CytoSPADE is implemented in R, Cþþ and Java.
