Bag of NaÃ¯ve Bayes (BoNB) is a software for genetic marker selection and subjects classification from the simultaneous analysis of genome-wide SNP data. BoNB is based on the NaÃ¯ve Bayes classification framework, enriched by three main features: bootstrap aggregating of an ensemble of NaÃ¯ve Bayes classifiers, a novel strategy for ranking and selecting the attributes used by each classifier in the ensemble and a permutation-based procedure for selecting significant biomarkers, based on their marginal utility in the classification process.
