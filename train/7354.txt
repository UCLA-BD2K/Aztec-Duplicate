Gaining insights into the structural determinants of protein–protein interactions holds the key for a deeper understanding of biological functions, diseases and development of thera-peutics. An important aspect of this is the ability to accurately predict the binding strength for a given protein–protein complex. Here we present PROtein binDIng enerGY prediction (PRODIGY), a web server to predict the binding affinity of protein–protein complexes from their 3D structure. The PRODIGY server implements our simple but highly effective predictive model based on inter-molecular contacts and properties derived from non-interface surface.
