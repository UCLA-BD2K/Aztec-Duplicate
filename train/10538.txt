Background: Post-translational modifications (PTMs) constitute a major aspect of protein biology, particularly signaling events. Conversely, several different pathophysiological PTMs are hallmarks of oxidative imbalance or inflammatory states and are strongly associated with pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases or cancers. Accordingly, it is of interest to assess both the biological and structural effects of modification. For the latter, computer-based modeling offers an attractive option. We thus identified the need for easily applicable modeling options for PTMs.
