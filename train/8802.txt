XDIA is a computational strategy for analyzing multiplexed spectra acquired using electron transfer dissociation and collision-activated dissociation; it significantly increases identified spectra (â¼250%) and unique peptides (â¼30%) when compared with the data-dependent ETCaD analysis on middle-down, single-phase shotgun proteomic analysis. Increasing identified spectra and peptides improves quantitation statistics confidence and protein coverage, respectively.
