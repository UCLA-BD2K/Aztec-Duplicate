The Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip is a new platform for high-throughput DNA methylation analysis. Several methods for normalization and processing of these data have been published recently. Here we present an integrated analysis pipeline offering a choice of the most popular normalization methods while also introducing new methods for calling differentially methylated regions and detecting copy number aberrations.
        Availability and implementation: ChAMP is implemented as a Bioconductor package in R. The package and the vignette can be downloaded at bioconductor.org
