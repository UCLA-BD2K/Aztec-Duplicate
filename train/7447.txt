The integrative analysis of multiple high-throughput data sources that are available for a common sample set is an increasingly common goal in biomedical research. Joint and individual variation explained (JIVE) is a tool for exploratory dimension reduction that decomposes a multi-source dataset into three terms: a low-rank approximation capturing joint variation across sources, low-rank approximations for structured variation individual to each source and residual noise. JIVE has been used to explore multi-source data for a variety of application areas but its accessibility was previously limited. We introduce R.JIVE, an intuitive R package to perform JIVE and visualize the results. We discuss several improvements and extensions of the JIVE methodology that are included. We illustrate the package with an application to multi-source breast tumor data from
