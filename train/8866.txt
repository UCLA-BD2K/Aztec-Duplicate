Motivation: A codon position could perform different or multiple roles in alternative transcripts of a gene. For instance, a non-synonymous position in one transcript could be a synonymous site in another. Alternatively, a position could remain as non-synonymous in multiple transcripts. Here we examined the impact of codon position plurality on the frequency of deleterious single-nucleotide variations (SNVs) using data from 6500 human exomes. Results: Our results showed that the proportion of deleterious SNVs was more than 2-fold higher in positions that remain non-synonymous in multiple transcripts compared with that observed in positions that are non-synonymous in one or some transcript(s) and synonymous or intronic in other(s). Furthermore, we observed a positive relationship between the fraction of deleterious non-synonymous SNVs and the number of proteins (alternative splice variants) affected. These results demonstrate that the plurality of codon positions is an important attribute , which could be useful in identifying mutations associated with diseases.
