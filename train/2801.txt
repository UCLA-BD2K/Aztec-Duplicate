The identification of robust lists of molecular biomarkers related to a disease is a fundamental step for early diagnosis and treatment. However, methodologies for the discovery of biomarkers using microarray data often provide results with limited overlap. These differences are imputable to 1) dataset size (few subjects with respect to the number of features); 2) heterogeneity of the disease; 3) heterogeneity of experimental protocols and computational pipelines employed in the analysis. Focusing on the first two issues,Ã‚ a simulation schema was developed to outline advantages and drawbacks of classification and feature selection methods on a benchmark with known biomarkers.
