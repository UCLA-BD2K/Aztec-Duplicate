The GENESIS package provides methodology for estimating, inferring, and accounting for population and pedigree structure in genetic analyses.  The current implementation provides functions to perform PC-AiR (Conomos et al., 2015): a Principal Components Analysis with genome-wide SNP genotype data for robust population structure inference in samples with related individuals (known or cryptic).
