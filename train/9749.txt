At the heart of many modern biotechnological and therapeutic applications lies the need to target specific genomic loci with pinpoint accuracy. Although landmark experiments demonstrate technological maturity in manufacturing and delivering genetic material , the genomic sequence analysis to find suitable targets lags behind. We provide a computational aid for the sophisticated design of sequence specific ligands and selection of appropriate targets, taking gene location and genomic architecture into account.
