LIFE is addressing a range of technical and scientific challenges related to collecting, integrating, searching, visualizing and analyzing large and feature-rich (big) data. All LINCS experimental assays can be searched using a simple User Interface LIFEwrx, which indexes the data from all the LINCS platforms.  LIFE is a knowledge based search system with an underlying ontology that semantically integrates the various LINCS signatures generated at different Centers based on relevant molecular entities (such as small molecules, genes, proteins), model systems (such as cell lines) and other concepts (such as diseases). LINCS data is further enriched and cross-referenced by various external data sources.
