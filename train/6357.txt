We present a tool, diCal-IBD, for detecting identity-by-descent (IBD) tracts between pairs of genomic sequences. Our method builds on a recent demographic inference method based on the coalescent with recombination, and is able to incorporate demographic information as a prior. Simulation study shows that diCal-IBD has significantly higher recall and precision than that of existing single-nucleotide polymorphismâ€“based IBD detection methods, while retaining reasonable accuracy for IBD tracts as small as 0.1 cM.
