This package provides a high-level R interface to CoreArray Genomic Data Structure (GDS) data files, which are portable across platforms and include hierarchical structure to store multiple scalable array-oriented data sets with metadata information. It is suited for large-scale datasets, especially for data which are much larger than the available random-access memory. The gdsfmt package offers the efficient operations specifically designed for integers with less than 8 bits, since a single genetic/genomic variant, like single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), usually occupies fewer bits than a byte. Data compression and decompression are also supported with relatively efficient random access. It is allowed to read a GDS file in parallel with multiple R processes supported by the package parallel.
