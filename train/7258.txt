We present a suite of UNIX shell programs for processing any number of phylogenetic trees of any size. They perform frequently-used tree operations without requiring user interaction. They also allow tree drawing as scalable vector graphics (SVG), suitable for high-quality presentations and further editing, and as ASCII graphics for command-line inspection. As an example we include an implementation of bootscanning, a procedure for finding recombination breakpoints in viral genomes. Availability: C source code, Python bindings and executables for various platforms are available from
