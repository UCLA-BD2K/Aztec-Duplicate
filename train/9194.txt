Motivation: Rknots is a flexible R package providing tools for the detection and characterization of topological knots in biological polymers. The package is well documented and provides a simple syntax for data import and preprocessing, structure reduction, topological analyses and 2D and 3D visualization. Remarkably, Rknots is not limited to protein knots and allows researchers from interdisciplinary fields to analyze different topological structures and to develop simple yet fully custom pipelines. Availability: Rknots is distributed under the GPL-2 license and is available from the CRAN (the Comprehensive R Archive network) at http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Rknots
