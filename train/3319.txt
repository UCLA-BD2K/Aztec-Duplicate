Motivation: A fundamental computational problem in the area of metabolic engineering is finding metabolic pathways between a pair of source and target metabolites efficiently. We present an approach , namely FogLight, for searching metabolic networks utilizing Boolean (AND-OR) operations represented in matrix notation to efficiently reduce the search space. This enables the enumeration of all pathways between metabolites that are too distant for the application of brute-force methods. Results: Benchmarking tests run with FogLight show that it can reduce the search space by up to 98%, after which the accelerated search for high accurate results is guaranteed. Using FogLight, several pathways between eight given pairs of metabolites are found of which the pathways from CO 2 to ethanol are specifically discussed. Additionally, in comparison with three path-finding tools, namely PHT, FMM and RouteSearch, FogLight can find shorter and more pathways for attempted source-target metabolite pairs.
