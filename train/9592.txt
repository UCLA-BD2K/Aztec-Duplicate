Because an enormous amount of sequence data is being collected, a method to effectively display sequence variation information is urgently needed. TASUKE is a web application that visualizes large-scale resequencing data generated by next-generation sequen-cing technologies and is suitable for rapid data release to the public on the web. The variation and read depths of multiple genomes, as well as annotations, can be shown simultaneously at various scales. We demonstrate the use of TASUKE by applying it to 50 rice and 100 human genome resequencing datasets. Availability and implementation: The TASUKE program package and user manual are available from http://tasuke.dna.affrc.go.jp/.
