Motivation: In silico methods provide efficient ways to predict possible interactions between drugs and targets. Supervised learning approach, bipartite local model (BLM), has recently been shown to be effective in prediction of drugâtarget interactions. However, for drug-candidate compounds or target-candidate proteins that currently have no known interactions available, its pure 'local' model is not able to be learned and hence BLM may fail to make correct prediction when involving such kind of new candidates. Results: We present a simple procedure called neighbor-based interaction-profile inferring (NII) and integrate it into the existing BLM method to handle the new candidate problem. Specifically, the inferred interaction profile is treated as label information and is used for model learning of new candidates. This functionality is particularly important in practice to find targets for new drug-candidate compounds and identify targeting drugs for new target-candidate proteins.
