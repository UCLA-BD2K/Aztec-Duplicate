Motivation: Novel technologies brought in unprecedented amounts of
high-throughput sequencing data along with great challenges in their analysis and
interpretation. The percent-spliced-in (PSI, )
metric estimates the incidence of single-exon–skipping events and can be computed
directly by counting reads that align to known or predicted splice junctions. However, the
majority of human splicing events are more complex than single-exon skipping.
        Results: In this short report, we present a framework that generalizes the
 metric to arbitrary classes of splicing
events. We change the view from exon centric to intron centric and split the value of
 into two indices,
 and ,
measuring the rate of splicing at the 5′ and 3′ end of the intron,
respectively. The advantage of having two separate indices is that they deconvolute two
distinct elementary acts of the splicing reaction. The completeness of splicing index is
decomposed in a similar way. This framework is implemented as
bam2ssj, a BAM-file–processing pipeline for strand-specific
counting of reads that align to splice junctions or overlap with splice sites. It can be
used as a consistent protocol for quantifying splice junctions from RNA-seq data because
no such standard procedure currently exists.
        Availability: The C
code of bam2ssj is open source and is available at https://github.com/pervouchine/bam2ssj
