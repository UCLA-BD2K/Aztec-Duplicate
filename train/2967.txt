Motivation: Real time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) is an important tool in quantitative studies of DNA and RNA molecules; especially in transcriptome studies, where different primer combinations allow identification of specific transcripts such as splice variants or precursor messenger RNA. Several softwares that implement various rules for optimal primer design are available. Nevertheless, as designing qPCR primers needs to be done manually, the repeated task is tedious, time consuming and prone to errors. Results: We used a set of rules to automatically design all possible exonâexon and intronâexon junctions in the human and mouse tran-scriptomes. The resulting database is included as a track in the UCSC genome browser, making it widely accessible and easy to use.
