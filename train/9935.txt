BlastGraph is an interactive Java program for comparative genome analysis based on Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST), graph clustering and data visualization. The software generates clusters of sequences of multiple genomes from all-to-all BLAST results and visualizes the results in graph plots together with related information such as sequence features, gene conservation and similarity relationships. Pruning algorithms are used to reduce results to more meaningful subclusters. Subsequent analyses can then be conducted based on the predicted clusters, including gene content, genome phylogenetics and gene gain and loss.
