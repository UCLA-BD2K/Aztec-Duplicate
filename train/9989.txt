ENViz (Enrichment Analysis and Visualization) is a Cytoscape app that performs joint enrichment analysis of two types of sample matched datasets in the context of systematic annotations. Such datasets may be gene expression or any other high-throughput data collected in the same set of samples. The enrichment analysis is done in the context of pathway information, gene ontology or any custom annotation of the data.
