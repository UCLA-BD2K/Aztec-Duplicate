Motivation: Conformational diversity is a key concept in the understanding of different issues related with protein function such as the study of catalytic processes in enzymes, protein-protein recognition , protein evolution and the origins of new biological functions. Here, we present a database of proteins with different degrees of conformational diversity. Conformational Diversity of Native State (CoDNaS) is a redundant collection of three-dimensional structures for the same protein derived from protein data bank. Structures for the same protein obtained under different crystallographic conditions have been associated with snapshots of protein dynamism and consequently could characterize protein conformers. CoDNaS allows the user to explore global and local structural differences among confor-mers as a function of different parameters such as presence of ligand, post-translational modifications, changes in oligomeric states and differences in pH and temperature. Additionally, CoDNaS contains information about protein taxonomy and function, disorder level and structural classification offering useful information to explore the underlying mechanism of conformational diversity and its close relationship with protein function. Currently, CoDNaS has 122 122 structures integrating 12 684 entries, with an average of 9.63 confor-mers per protein. Availability: The database is freely available at http://www.codnas. com.ar/.
