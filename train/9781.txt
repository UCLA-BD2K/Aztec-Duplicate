Epigenetics, the study of heritable somatic phenotypic changes not related to DNA sequence, has emerged as a critical component of the landscape of gene regulation. The epigenetic layers, such as DNA methylation, histone modifications and nuclear architecture are now being extensively studied in many cell types and disease settings. Few software tools exist to summarize and interpret these datasets. We have created a toolbox of procedures to interrogate and visualize epigenomic data (both array-and sequencing-based) and make available a software package for the cross-platform R language. Availability: The package is freely available under LGPL from the R-Forge web site (http://repitools.r-forge.r-project.org/) Contact:
