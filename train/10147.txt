flowDensity facilitates reproducible, high-throughput analysis of flow cytometry data by automating a predefined manual gating approach. The algorithm is based on a sequential bivariate gating approach that generates a set of predefined cell populations. It chooses the best cutoff for individual markers using characteristics of the density distribution. The Supplementary Material is linked to the online version of the manuscript.
