NMR protein structure refinement. Amber (acronym to Assisted Model Building with Energy Refinement) is a suite of programs  1N3L that allow users to perform molecular dynamics (MD) simulations on biological systems. This web portal makes available the entire functionality of AMBER, in particular (but not only) using NMR-derived information as restraints for MD.
