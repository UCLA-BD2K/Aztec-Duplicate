Data processing, analysis and visualization (datPAV) is an exploratory tool that allows experimentalist to quickly assess the general characteristics of the data. This platform-independent software is designed as a generic tool to process and visualize data matrices. This tool explores organization of the data, detect errors and support basic statistical analyses. Processed data can be reused whereby different step-by-step data processing/analysis workflows can be created to carry out detailed investigation. The visualization option provides publication-ready graphics. Applications of this tool are demonstrated at the web site for three cases of metabolomics, environmental and hydrodynamic data analysis.
