We developed a novel algorithm, PurityEst, to infer the tumor purity level from the allelic differential representation of hetero-zygous loci with somatic mutations in a human tumor sample with a matched normal tissue using next-generation sequencing data. We applied our tool to a whole cancer genome sequencing datasets and demonstrated the accuracy of PurityEst compared with DNA copy number-based estimation. Availability: PurityEst has been implemented in PERL and is available at
