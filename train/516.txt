Abstract
        
Summary: MetaboSignal is an R package that allows merging metabolic and signaling pathways reported in the Kyoto Encyclopaedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG). It is a network-based approach designed to navigate through topological relationships between genes (signaling- or metabolic-genes) and metabolites, representing a powerful tool to investigate the genetic landscape of metabolic phenotypes.
        
Availability and Implementation: MetaboSignal is available from Bioconductor: https://bioconductor.org/packages/MetaboSignal/
