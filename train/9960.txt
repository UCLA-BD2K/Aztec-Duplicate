Rule-based models are analyzed with specialized simulators, such as those provided by the BioNetGen and NFsim open-source software packages. Here, we present BioNetFit, a general-purpose fitting tool that is compatible with BioNetGen and NFsim. BioNetFit is designed to take advantage of distributed computing resources. This feature facilitates fitting (i.e. optimization of parameter values for consistency with data) when simulations are computationally expensive. Availability and implementation: BioNetFit can be used on stand-alone Mac, Windows/Cygwin, and Linux platforms and on Linux-based clusters running SLURM, Torque/PBS, or SGE. The BioNetFit source code (Perl) is freely available (http://bionetfit.nau.edu).
