Summary: Genotype imputation is now commonly performed following genome-wide genotyping experiments. Imputation increases the density of analyzed genotypes in the dataset, enabling fine-mapping across the genome. However, the process of imputation using the most recent publicly available reference datasets can require considerable computation power and the management of hundreds of large intermediate files. We have developed genipe, a complete genome-wide imputation pipeline which includes automatic reporting, imputed data indexing and management, and a suite of statistical tests for imputed data commonly used in genetic epidemiology (Sequence Kernel Association Test, Cox proportional hazards for survival analysis, and linear mixed models for repeated measurements in longitudinal studies).
