Motivation: We have developed geneAttribution, an R package that assigns candidate causal gene(s) to a risk variant identified by a genetic association study such as a GWAS. The method combines user-supplied functional annotation such as expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) or Hi-C genome conformation data and reports the most likely candidate genes. In the absence of annotation data, geneAttribution relies on the distances between the genes and the input variant.
        Availability and Implementation: The package is freely available from http://www.bioconductor.org/. A quick-start vignette is included with the package.
