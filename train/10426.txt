Current sequence alignment browsers allow visualization of large and complex next-generation sequencing datasets. However, most of these tools provide inadequate display of insertions and can be cumbersome to use on large datasets. I implemented PyBamView, a lightweight Web application for visualizing short read alignments. It provides an easy-to-use Web interface for viewing alignments across multiple samples, with a focus on accurate visualization of insertions. Availability and Implementation: PyBamView is available as a standard python package. The source code is freely available under the MIT license at https://mgymrek.github.io/pybamview.
