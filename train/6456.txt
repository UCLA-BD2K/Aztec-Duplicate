ExpressionView is an R package that provides an interactive graphical environment to explore transcription modules identified in gene expression data. A sophisticated ordering algorithm is used to present the modules with the expression in a visually appealing layout that provides an intuitive summary of the results. From this overview, the user can select individual modules and access biologically relevant metadata associated with them.
