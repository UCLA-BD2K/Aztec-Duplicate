Motivation: The sheer scale of the metagenomic and metatranscrip-tomic datasets that are now available warrants the development of automated protocols for organizing, annotating and comparing the samples in terms of their metabolic profiles. We describe a user-friendly java program FROMP (Fragment Recruitment on Metabolic Pathways) for mapping and visualizing enzyme annotations onto the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) metabolic pathways or custom-made pathways and comparing the samples in terms of their Pathway Completeness Scores, their relative Activity Scores or enzyme enrichment odds ratios. This program along with our fully configurable PERL-based annotation organization pipeline Meta2Pro (METAbolic PROfiling of META-omic data) offers a quick and accurate standalone solution for metabolic profiling of environmental samples or cultures from different treatments. Apart from pictorial comparisons, FROMP can also generate score matrices for multiple meta-omics samples, which can be used directly by other statistical programs.
