This package provides a generic function for estimating positron emission tomography (PET) neuroreceptor occupancies from the total volumes of distribution of a set of regions of interest. Fittings methods include the simple 'reference region' and 'ordinary least squares' (sometimes known as occupancy plot) methods, as well as the more efficient 'restricted maximum likelihood estimation'.
