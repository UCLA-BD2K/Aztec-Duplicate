g:GOSt performs functional profiling of gene lists using various kinds of biological evidence. The tool performs statistical enrichment analysis to find over-representation of information like Gene Ontology terms, biological pathways, regulatory DNA elements, human disease gene annotations, and protein-protein interaction networks. Its output is a tabular graphic where genes are shown in columns, functions in rows, and coloured table cells show functional associations. The basic input of g:GOSt is a list of genes.
