STAMP is a graphical software package that provides statistical hypothesis tests and exploratory plots for analysing taxo-nomic and functional profiles. It supports tests for comparing pairs of samples or samples organized into two or more treatment groups. Effect sizes and confidence intervals are provided to allow critical assessment of the biological relevancy of test results. A user-friendly graphical interface permits easy exploration of statistical results and generation of publication-quality plots. Availability and implementation: STAMP is licensed under the GNU GPL.
