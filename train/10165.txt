MALDIquant is an R package providing a complete and modular analysis pipeline for quantitative analysis of mass spectro-metry data. MALDIquant is specifically designed with application in clinical diagnostics in mind and implements sophisticated routines for importing raw data, preprocessing, non-linear peak alignment and calibration. It also handles technical replicates as well as spectra with unequal resolution. Availability: MALDIquant and its associated R packages readBrukerFlexData and readMzXmlData are freely available from the R archive CRAN (http://cran.r-project.org).
