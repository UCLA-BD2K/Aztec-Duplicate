As new methods for multivariate analysis of genome wide association studies become available, it is important to be able to combine results from different cohorts in a meta-analysis. The R package MultiMeta provides an implementation of the inverse-variance-based method for meta-analysis, generalized to an n-dimensional setting. Availability and implementation: The R package MultiMeta can be downloaded from CRAN.
