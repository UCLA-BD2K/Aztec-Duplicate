PANDA (Passing Attributes between Networks for Data Assimilation) is a gene regulatory network inference method that uses message-passing to integrate multiple sources of 'omics data. PANDA was originally coded in C þþ. In this application note we describe PyPanda, the Python version of PANDA. PyPanda runs considerably faster than the C þþ version and includes additional features for network analysis. Availability and implementation: The open source PyPanda Python package is freely available at
