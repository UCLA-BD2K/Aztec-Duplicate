The original RootTrace tool has proved successful in measuring primary root lengths across time series image data. Biologists have shown interest in using the tool to address further problems, namely counting lateral roots to use as parameters in screening studies, and measuring highly curved roots. To address this, the software has been extended to count emerged lateral roots, and the tracking model extended so that strongly curved and agravitropic roots can be now be recovered. Here, we describe the novel image analysis algorithms and user interface implemented within the RootTrace framework to handle such situations and evaluate the results. Availability: The software is open source and available from http:// sourceforge.net/projects/roottrace.
