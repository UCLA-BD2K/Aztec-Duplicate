DivBayes is a program to estimate diversification rates from species richness and ages of a set of clades. SubT estimates diversification rates from node heights within a clade. Both programs implement Bayesian statistics and provide the ability to account for uncertainty in the ages of taxa in the underlying data, an improvement over more commonly used maximum likelihood methods.
