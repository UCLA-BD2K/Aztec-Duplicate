Summary: We describe an integrative software platform, Prequips, for comparative proteomics-based systems biology analysis that: (i) integrates all information generated from mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics as well as from basic proteomics data analysis tools, (ii) visualizes such information for various proteomic analyses via graphical interfaces and (iii) links peptide and protein abundances to external tools often used in systems biology studies.
