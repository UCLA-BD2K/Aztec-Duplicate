WU-BLAST (Washington University Basic Local Alignment Search Tool) Version 2.0 is used to compare a sequence with those contained in nucleotide and protein databases by aligning the sequence with previously characterized genes. The emphasis of this tool is to find regions of sequence similarity, which will yield functional and evolutionary clues about the structure and function of this novel sequence. Regions of similarity detected via this type of alignment tool can be either local, where the region of similarity is based in 1 location, or global, where regions of similarity can be detected across otherwise unrelated genetic code.

WU-BLAST and NCBI BLAST are distinctly different software packages, although they have a common lineage for some portions of their code, so the services do their work differently, obtain different results and offer different features.
