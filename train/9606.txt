Motivation: The growth of next-generation sequencing means that more effective and efficient archiving methods are needed to store the generated data for public dissemination and in anticipation of more mature analytical methods later. This article examines methods for compressing the quality score component of the data to partly address this problem. Results: We compare several compression policies for quality scores, in terms of both compression effectiveness and overall efficiency. The policies employ lossy and lossless transformations with one of several coding schemes. Experiments show that both lossy and lossless transformations are useful, and that simple coding methods, which consume less computing resources, are highly competitive, especially when random access to reads is needed.
