ConsensusPathDB-human integrates interaction networks in Homo sapiens including binary and complex protein-protein, genetic, metabolic,  signaling, gene regulatory and drug-target interactions, as well as biochemical pathways. Data originate from multiple public resources for interactions and interactions curated from the literature. The interaction data are integrated in a complementary manner (avoiding redundancies), resulting in a seamless interaction network containing different types of interactions.
