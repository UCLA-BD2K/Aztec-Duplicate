Ability to generate large RNA-Seq datasets created a demand for both de novo and reference based transcriptome assemblers. However, while many transcriptome assemblers are now available, there is still no unified quality assessment tool for RNA-Seq assemblies. We present rnaQUASTâ€”a tool for evaluating RNA-Seq assembly quality and benchmarking transcriptome as-semblers using reference genome and gene database. rnaQUAST calculates various metrics that demonstrate completeness and correctness levels of the assembled transcripts, and outputs them in a user-friendly report. Availability and Implementation: rnaQUAST is implemented in Python and is freely available at
