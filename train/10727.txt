Plant microRNA prediction tools that use small RNA-sequencing data are emerging quickly. These existing tools have at least one of the following problems: (i) high false-positive rate; (ii) long running time; (iii) work only for genomes in their databases; (iv) hard to install or use. We developed miR-PREFeR (miRNA PREdiction From small RNA-Seq data), which uses expression patterns of miRNA and follows the criteria for plant microRNA annotation to accurately predict plant miRNAs from one or more small RNA-Seq data samples of the same species. We tested miR-PREFeR on several plant species. The results show that miR-PREFeR is sensitive, accurate, fast and has low-memory footprint. Availability and implementation: https://github.com
