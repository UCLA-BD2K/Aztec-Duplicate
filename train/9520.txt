We describe a tool for quantifying the uniformity of mapped reads in high-throughput sequencing experiments. Our statistic directly measures the uniformity of both read position and fragment length, and we explain how to compute a P-value that can be used to quantify biases arising from experimental protocols and mapping procedures. Our method is useful for comparing different protocols in experiments such as RNA-Seq. Availability and implementation: We provide a freely available and open source python script that can be used to analyze raw read data or reads mapped to transcripts in BAM format at
