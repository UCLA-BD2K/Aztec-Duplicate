Intrinsically unstructured/disordered proteins have no single well-defined tertiary structure in their native, functional state. IUPred recognizes such regions from the amino acid sequence based on the estimated pairwise energy content. The underlying assumption is that globular proteins are composed of amino acids which have the potential to form a large number of favorable interactions, whereas intrinsically unstructured proteins (IUPs) adopt no stable structure because their amino acid composition does not allow sufficient favorable interactions to form.
