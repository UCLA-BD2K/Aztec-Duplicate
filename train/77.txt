Summary:ArrayExpress is one of the largest public repositories of microarray datasets. R/Bioconductor provides a comprehensive suite of microarray analysis and integrative bioinformatics software. However, easy ways for importing datasets from ArrayExpress into R/Bioconductor have been lacking. Here, we present such a tool that is suitable for both interactive and automated use.
        Availability: The ArrayExpress package is available from the Bioconductor project at http://www.bioconductor.org. A users guide and examples are provided with the package.
