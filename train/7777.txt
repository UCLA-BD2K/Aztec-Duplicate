Motivation: Gene expression data are currently collected on a wide range of platforms. Differences between platforms make it challenging to combine and compare data collected on different platforms. We propose a new method of cross-platform normalization that uses topic models to summarize the expression patterns in each dataset before normalizing the topics learned from each dataset using per-gene multiplicative weights. Results: This method allows for cross-platform normalization even when samples profiled on different platforms have systematic differences , allows the simultaneous normalization of data from an arbitrary number of platforms and, after suitable training, allows for online nor-malization of expression data collected individually or in small batches. In addition, our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art platform normalization tools. Availability and implementation: MATLAB code is available at
