Slice:Drop is a web-based 2D/3D viewer using WebGL and HTML5 Canvas to perform image rendering in a web browser. Based on the open source XTK toolkit, Slice:Drop runs on computers and mobile devices. On systems with a filesystem, image files may be dropped on the rendering window, and all data stays within the browser. Many medical image file formats are supported natively.
