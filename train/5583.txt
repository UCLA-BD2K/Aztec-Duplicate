From extensive analyses of all human transcripts, H-InvDB provides curated annotations of human genes and transcripts that include gene structures, alternative splicing isoforms, non-coding functional RNAs, protein functions, functional domains, sub-cellular localizations, metabolic pathways, protein 3D structure, genetic polymorphisms (SNPs, indels and microsatellite repeats), relation with diseases, gene expression profiling, and molecular evolutionary features , protein-protein interactions (PPIs) and gene families/groups.
