PhamDB is a web application which creates databases of bacteriophage genes, grouped by gene similarity. It is backwards compatible with the existing Phamerator desktop software while providing an improved database creation workflow. Key features include a graphical user interface, validation of uploaded GenBank files, and abilities to import phages from existing databases, modify existing databases and queue multiple jobs. Availability and implementation: Source code and installation instructions for Linux, Windows and Mac OSX are freely available at https://github.com/jglamine/phage. PhamDB is also distributed as a docker image which can be managed via Kitematic. This docker image contains the application and all third party software dependencies as a pre-configured system, and is freely available via the installation instructions provided.
