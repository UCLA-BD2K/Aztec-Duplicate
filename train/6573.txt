Motivation: Univariate Cox regression (COX) is often used to select genes possibly linked to survival. With non-proportional hazards (NPH), COX could lead to under-or over-estimation of effects. The effect size measure c = P(T 1 probability that a person randomly chosen from group G 1 dies earlier than a person from G 0 , is independent of the proportional hazards (PH) assumption. Here we consider its generalization to continuous data c and investigate the suitability of c for gene selection. Results: Under PH, c is most efficiently estimated by COX. Under NPH, c can be obtained by weighted Cox regression (WHE) or a novel method, concordance regression (CON). The least biased and most stable estimates were obtained by CON. We propose to use c as summary measure of effect size to rank genes irrespective of different types of NPH and censoring patterns.
