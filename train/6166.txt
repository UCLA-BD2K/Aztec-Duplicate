Motivation: Both single marker and simultaneous analysis face challenges in GWAS due to the large number of markers genotyped for a small number of subjects. This large p small n problem is particularly challenging when the trait under investigation has low heritability. Method: In this article, we propose a two-stage approach that is a hybrid method of single and simultaneous analysis designed to improve genomic prediction of complex traits. In the first stage, we use a Bayesian independent screening method to select the most promising SNPs. In the second stage, we rely on a hierarchical model to analyze the joint impact of the selected markers. The model is designed to take into account familial dependence in the different subjects, while using local-global shrinkage priors on the marker effects. Results: We evaluate the performance in simulation studies, and consider an application to animal breeding data. The illustrative data analysis reveals an encouraging result in terms of prediction performance and computational cost.
