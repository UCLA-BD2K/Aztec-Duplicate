ENSEMBLE is a computational approach for determining a set of conformations that represents the structural ensemble of a disordered protein based on input experimental data. The disordered protein can be an unfolded or intrinsically disordered state. Here, we introduce the latest version of the program, which has been enhanced to facilitate its general release and includes an intuitive user interface, as well as new approaches to treat data and analyse results. Availability and implementation: ENSEMBLE is a program implemented in C and embedded in a Perl wrapper. It is supported on main Linux distributions. Source codes and installation files, including a detailed example, can be freely downloaded at
