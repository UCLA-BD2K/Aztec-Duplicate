Effective access to the vast biomedical knowledge present in the scientific literature is challenging. Semantic relations are increasingly used in knowledge management applications supporting bio-medical research to help address this challenge. We describe SemMedDB, a repository of semantic predications (subjectâpredi-cateâobject triples) extracted from the entire set of PubMed citations. We propose the repository as a knowledge resource that can assist in hypothesis generation and literature-based discovery in biomedicine as well as in clinical decision-making support. Availability and implementation: The SemMedDB repository is available as a MySQL database for non-commercial use at http://skr3. nlm.nih.gov/SemMedDB. An UMLS Metathesaurus license is required.
