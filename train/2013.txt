The Iterative Signature Algorithm (ISA) is a biclustering method; it finds correlated blocks (transcription modules) in gene expression (or other tabular) data. The ISA is capable of finding overlapping modules and it is resilient to noise. This package provides a convenient interface to the ISA, using standard BioConductor data structures; and also contains various visualization tools that can be used with other biclustering algorithms.
