Motivation: Retrocopies are copies of mature RNAs that are usually devoid of regulatory sequences and introns. They have routinely been classified as processed pseudo-genes with little or no biological relevance. However, recent findings have revealed functional roles for ret-rocopies, as well as their high frequency in some organisms, such as primates. Despite their increasing importance, there is no user-friendly and publicly available resource for the study of retrocopies. Results: Here, we present RCPedia, an integrative and user-friendly database designed for the study of retrocopied genes. RCPedia contains a complete catalogue of the retrocopies that are known to be present in human and five other primate genomes, their genomic context, inter-species conservation and gene expression data. RCPedia also offers a streamlined data representation and an efficient query system. Availability and implementation: RCPedia is available at http://www. bioinfo.
