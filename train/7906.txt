Protein interaction networks are widely used to depict the relationships between proteins. These networks often lack the information on physical binary interactions, and they do not inform whether there is incompatibility of structure between binding partners. Here, we introduce SAPIN, a framework dedicated to the structural analysis of protein interaction networks. SAPIN first identifies the protein parts that could be involved in the interaction and provides template structures. Next, SAPIN performs structural superimpositions to identify compatible and mutually exclusive interactions. Finally, the results are displayed using Cytoscape Web.
