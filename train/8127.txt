Although small non-coding RNAs, such as microRNAs, have well-established functions in the cell, long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have only recently started to emerge as abundant regulators of cell physiology, and their functions may be diverse. A small number of studies describe interactions between small and lncRNAs, with lncRNAs acting either as inhibitory decoys or as regulatory targets of microRNAs, but such interactions are still poorly explored. To facilitate the study of microRNAâlncRNA interactions, we implemented miRcode: a comprehensive searchable map of putative microRNA target sites across the complete GENCODE annotated transcriptome, including 10 419 lncRNA genes in the current version.
