Motivation: Sequence-specific transcription factors (TFs) regulate the expression of their target genes through interactions with specific DNA-binding sites in the genome. Data on TF-DNA binding specifici-ties are essential for understanding how regulatory specificity is achieved. Results: Numerous studies have used universal protein-binding microarray (PBM) technology to determine the in vitro binding specifi-cities of hundreds of TFs for all possible 8 bp sequences (8mers). We have developed a Bayesian analysis of variance (ANOVA) model that decomposes these 8mer data into background noise, TF family-wise effects and effects due to the particular TF. Adjusting for background noise improves PBM data quality and concordance with in vivo TF binding data. Moreover, our model provides simultaneous identification of TF subclasses and their shared sequence preferences, and also of 8mers bound preferentially by individual members of TF sub-classes. Such results may aid in deciphering cis-regulatory codes and determinants of proteinâ€“DNA binding specificity.
