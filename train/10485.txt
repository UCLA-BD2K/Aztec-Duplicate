Motivation: The reverse-phase protein lysate arrays have been used to quantify the relative expression levels of a protein in a number of cellular samples simultaneously. To avoid quantification bias due to mis-specification of commonly used parametric models, a nonparametric approach based on monotone response curves may be used. The existing methods, however, aggregate the protein concentration levels of replicates of each sample, and therefore fail to account for within-sample variability. Results: We propose a method of regularization on protein concentration estimation at the level of individual dilution series to account for within-sample or within-group variability. We use an efficient algorithm to optimize an approximate objective function, with a data-adaptive approach to choose the level of shrinkage. Simulation results show that the proposed method quantifies protein concentration levels well. We show through the analysis of protein lysate array data from cell lines of different cancer groups that accounting for within-sample variability leads to better statistical analysis.
