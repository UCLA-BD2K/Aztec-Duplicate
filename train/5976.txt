Wrapper functions that interface with FSL (http://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/), a powerful and commonly-used neuroimaging software, using system commands. The goal is to be able to interface with FSL completely in R, where you pass R objects of class "nifti", implemented by package 'oro.nifti', and the function executes an FSL command and returns an R object of class "nifti" if desired.
