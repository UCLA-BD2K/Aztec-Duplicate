Here we introduce catRAPID omics, a server for large-scale calculations of proteinâRNA interactions. Our web server allows (i) predictions at proteomic and transcriptomic level; (ii) use of protein and RNA sequences without size restriction; (iii) analysis of nucleic acid binding regions in proteins; and (iv) detection of RNA motifs involved in protein recognition. Results: We developed a web server to allow fast calculation of ribonucleoprotein associations in Caenorhabditis elegans, Danio rerio, Drosophila melanogaster, Homo sapiens, Mus musculus, Rattus norvegicus, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Xenopus tropicalis (custom libraries can be also generated). The catRAPID omics was benchmarked on the recently published RNA interactomes of Serine/ arginine-rich splicing factor 1 (SRSF1), Histone-lysine N-methyltrans-ferase EZH2 (EZH2), TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP43) and RNA-binding protein FUS (FUS) as well as on the protein interactomes of U1/U2 small nucleolar RNAs, X inactive specific transcript (Xist) repeat A region (RepA) and Crumbs homolog 3 (CRB3) 3 0-untranslated region RNAs. Our predictions are highly significant (P50.05) and will help the experimentalist to identify candidates for further validation. Availability: catRAPID omics can be freely accessed on the Web at
