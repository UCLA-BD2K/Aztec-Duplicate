Genotype-phenotype data integration platform that includes a diversity of human, model, and non-model organisms. Data integration is accomplished using a large suite of interoperable ontologies, including the Human Phenotype Ontology and the Uberon anatomy ontology. Downstream tools such as Exomiser leverage these data for disease diagnostics and variant prioritization. These integrated data are available for computational reuse and deep phenotyping quality assurance.
