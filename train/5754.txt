Vinci (Volume Imaging in Neurological Research, Co-Registration and ROIs included&) was designed for the visualization and analysis of volume data, particularly neurological PET scans. It supports DICOM and several file formats common in nuclear medicine applications: ECAT and Interfile. Vinci support multiple orthogonal displays, VOI and ROI features, modifiable color maps, and several reslicing/resampling modes. Co-registration is provided in automatic and semi-automatic modes. The program is based on an extensible plugin framework and may be scripted and remotely controlled through an API.
