The procoil package allows to predict whether a coiled coil sequence (amino acid sequence plus heptad register) is more likely to form a dimer or more likely to form a trimer. The predict function not only computes the prediction itself, but also a profile which allows to determine the strengths to which the individual residues are indicative for either class. Profiles can also be plotted and exported to files.
