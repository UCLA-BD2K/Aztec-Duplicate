Motivation: Much of the biological knowledge accumulated over the last decades is stored in different databases governed by various organizations and institutes. Integrating and connecting these vast knowledge repositories is an extremely useful method to support life sciences research and help formulate novel hypotheses. Results: We developed the Network Library (NL), a framework and toolset to rapidly integrate different knowledge sources to build a network biology resource that matches a specific research question. As a use-case we explore the interactions of genes related to heart failure with miRNAs and diseases through the integration of 6 databases. Availability and Implementation: The NL is open-source, developed in Java and available on Github (https://
