The Global Proteome Machine and Database (GPMDB) representational state transfer (REST) service was designed to provide simplified access to the proteomics information in GPMDB using a stable set of methods and parameters. Version 1 of this interface gives access to 25 methods for retrieving experimental information about protein post-translational modifications, amino acid variants, alternate splicing variants and protein cleavage patterns. Availability and implementation: GPMDB data and database tables are freely available for commercial and non-commercial use. All software is also freely available, under the Artistic License. http://rest.thegpm.org/1 (GPMDB REST Service), http://wiki.thegpm.org/wiki/GPMDB_REST (Service description and help), and http://www.thegpm.org (GPM main project description and documentation). The code for the interface and an example REST client is available at ftp://ftp.
