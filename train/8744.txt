Motivation: The pre-estimate of the proportion of null hypotheses (π 0) plays a critical role in controlling false discovery rate (FDR) in multiple hypothesis testing. However, hidden complex dependence structures of many genomics datasets distort the distribution of p-values, rendering existing π 0 estimators less effective. Results: From the basic non-linear model of the q-value method, we developed a simple linear algorithm to probe local dependence blocks. We uncovered a non-static relationship between tests' p-values and their corresponding q-values that is influenced by data structure and π 0. Using an optimization framework, these findings were exploited to devise a Sliding Linear Model (SLIM) to more reliably estimate π 0 under dependence. When tested on a number of simulation datasets with varying data dependence structures and on microarray data, SLIM was found to be robust in estimating π 0 against dependence. The accuracy of its π 0 estimation suggests that SLIM can be used as a stand-alone tool for prediction of significant tests. Availability: The R code of the proposed method is available at
