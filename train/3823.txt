Motivation: Polyadenylation is an essential process during eukaryotic gene expression. Prediction of poly(A) sites helps to define the 3 0 end of genes, which is important for gene annotation and elucidating gene regulation mechanisms. However, due to limited knowledge of poly(A) signals, it is still challenging to predict poly(A) sites in plants and algae. PASPA is a web server for poly(A) site prediction in plants and algae, which integrates many in-house tools as add-ons to facilitate poly(A) site prediction, visualization and mining. This server can predict poly(A) sites for ten species , including seven previously poly(A) signal non-characterized species, with sensitivity and spe-cificity in a range between 0.80 and 0.95.
