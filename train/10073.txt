Motivation: The comparison of genes and gene products across species depends on high-quality tools to determine the relationships between gene or protein sequences from various species. Although some excellent applications are available and widely used, their performance leaves room for improvement. Results: We developed orthAgogue: a multithreaded C application for high-speed estimation of homology relations in massive datasets, operated via a flexible and easy command-line interface.
