DoMosaics is an application that unifies protein domain annotation, domain arrangement analysis and visualization in a single tool. It simplifies the analysis of protein families by consolidating disjunct procedures based on often inconvenient command-line applications and complex analysis tools. It provides a simple user interface with access to domain annotation services such as InterProScan or a local HMMER installation, and can be used to compare , analyze and visualize the evolution of domain architectures.
