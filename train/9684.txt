An ultrafast DNA sequence aligner (Isaac Genome Alignment Software) that takes advantage of high-memory hardware (448 GB) and variant caller (Isaac Variant Caller) have been developed. We demonstrate that our combined pipeline (Isaac) is four to five times faster than BWA Ã¾ GATK on equivalent hardware, with comparable accuracy as measured by trio conflict rates and sensitivity. We further show that Isaac is effective in the detection of disease-causing variants and can easily/economically be run on commodity hardware.
