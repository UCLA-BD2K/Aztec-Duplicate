The eukaryotic transcriptome is composed of thousands of coding and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs). However, we lack a software platform to identify both RNA classes in a given tran-scriptome. Here we introduce Annocript, a pipeline that combines the annotation of protein coding transcripts with the prediction of putative lncRNAs in whole transcriptomes. It downloads and indexes the needed databases, runs the analysis and produces human readable and standard outputs together with summary statistics of the whole analysis.
