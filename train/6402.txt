Motivation: The interaction between drugs and their targets, often proteins, and between antibodies and their targets, is important for planning and analyzing investigational and therapeutic interventions in many biological systems. Although drug-target and antibody-target datasets are available in separate databases, they are not publicly available in an integrated bioinformatics resource. As medical thera-peutics, especially in cancer, increasingly uses targeted drugs and measures their effects on biomolecular profiles, there is an unmet need for a user-friendly toolset that allows researchers to comprehensively and conveniently access and query information about drugs, antibodies and their targets. Summary: The PiHelper framework integrates human drug-target and antibody-target associations from publicly available resources to help meet the needs of researchers in systems pharmacology, perturbation biology and proteomics. PiHelper has utilities to (i) import drug-and antibody-target information; (ii) search the associations either pro-grammatically or through a web user interface (UI); (iii) visualize the data interactively in a network; and (iv) export relationships for use in publications or other analysis tools.

We plan to coordinate contributions from the community by managing future releases. Contact:
