The package implements algorithms to estimate and visualize the orientation of neuronal pathways in model-free methods (q-space imaging methods). For estimating fibre orientations two methods have been implemented. One method implements fibre orientation detection through local maxima extraction. A second more robust method is based on directional statistical clustering of ODF voxel data. Fibre orientations in multiple fibre voxels are estimated using a mixture of von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distributions. This statistical estimation procedure is used to resolve crossing fibre configurations. Reconstruction of orientation distribution function (ODF) profiles may be performed using the standard generalized q-sampling imaging (GQI) approach, Garyfallidis' GQI (GQI2) approach, or Aganj's variant of the Q-ball imaging (CSA-QBI) approach. Procedures for the visualization of RGB-maps, line-maps and glyph-maps of real diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) data-sets are included in the package.
