The prediction of proteinâprotein complexes from the structures of unbound components is a challenging and powerful strategy to decipher the mechanism of many essential biological processes. We present a user-friendly proteinâprotein docking server based on an improved version of FRODOCK that includes a complementary knowledge-based potential. The web interface provides a very effective tool to explore and select proteinâprotein models and interactively screen them against experimental distance constraints. The competitive success rates and efficiency achieved allow the retrieval of reliable potential proteinâprotein binding conformations that can be further refined with more computationally demanding strategies. Availability and Implementation: The server is free and open to all users with no login requirement at http://
