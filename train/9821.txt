The NARWHAL software pipeline has been developed to automate the primary analysis of Illumina sequencing data. This pipeline combines a new and flexible de-multiplexing tool with open-source aligners and automated quality assessment. The entire pipeline can be run using only one simple sample-sheet for diverse sequencing applications. NARWHAL creates a sample-oriented data structure and outperforms existing tools in speed.
