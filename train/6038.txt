RNAhybrid is a tool for finding the minimum free energy hybridization of a long and a short RNA. The hybridization is performed in a kind of domain mode, ie. the short sequence is hybridized to the best fitting part of the long one. The tool is primarily meant as a means for microRNA target prediction.
