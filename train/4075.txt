Today's genome browsers and protein databanks supply vast amounts of information about proteins. The challenge is to concisely bring together this information in an interactive and easy to generate format. Availability and implementation: We have developed an interactive CIRCOS module called i-PV to visualize user supplied protein sequence, conservation and SNV data in a live presentable format. I-PV can be downloaded from http://www.i
