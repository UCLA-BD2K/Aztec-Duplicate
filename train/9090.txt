Measuring motif similarity is essential for identifying functionally related transcription factors (TFs) and RNA-binding proteins, and for annotating de novo motifs. Here, we describe Motif Similarity Based on Affinity of Targets (MoSBAT), an approach for measuring the similarity of motifs by computing their affinity profiles across a large number of random sequences. We show that MoSBAT successfully associates de novo ChIP-seq motifs with their respective TFs, accurately identifies motifs that are obtained from the same TF in different in vitro assays, and quantitatively reflects the similarity of in vitro binding preferences for pairs of TFs. Availability and implementation: MoSBAT is available as a webserver at mosbat.ccbr.utoronto.ca, and for download at github.com/csglab/MoSBAT. Contact:
