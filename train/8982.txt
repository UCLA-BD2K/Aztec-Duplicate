Functional modules within protein sequences are often extracted by consensus sequence patterns representing a linear motif; however, other functional regions may only be described by combined features such as amino acid composition, profiles of amino acid properties and randomly distributed short sequence motifs. If only a small number of functional examples are well characterized , the researcher needs a tool to extract similar sequences for further investigation. Availability and Implementation: We provide the web application 'SAPA tool', which allows the user to search with combined properties , ranks the extracted target regions by an integrated score, estimates false discovery rates by using decoy sequences and provides them as a sequence file or spreadsheet. Source code, user manual and the web application implemented in Perl, HTML, CSS and JavaScript and running on Apache are freely available at http://sapa
