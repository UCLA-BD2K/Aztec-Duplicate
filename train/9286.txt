Proteinâprotein interactions play a critical role in many biological processes. Despite that, the number of servers that provide an easy and comprehensive method to predict them is still limited. Here, we present iLoops, a web server that predicts whether a pair of proteins can interact using local structural features. The inputs of the server are as follows: (i) the sequences of the query proteins and (ii) the pairs to be tested. Structural features are assigned to the query proteins by sequence similarity. Pairs of structural features (formed by loops or domains) are classified according to their likelihood to favor or disfavor a proteinâprotein interaction, depending on their observation in known interacting and non-interacting pairs. The server evaluates the putative interaction using a random forest classifier. Availability: iLoops is available at
