RIPPER is a framework for mass-spectrometry-based label-free relative quantification for proteomics and metabolomics studies. RIPPER combines a series of previously described algorithms for pre-processing, analyte quantification, retention time alignment, and analyte grouping across runs. It is also the first software framework to implement proximity-based intensity normal-ization. RIPPER produces lists of analyte signals with their unnormalized and normalized intensities that can serve as input to statistical and directed mass spectrometry (MS) methods for detecting quantitative differences between biological samples using MS.
