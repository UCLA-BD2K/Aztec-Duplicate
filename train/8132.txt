BraTumIA is a software dedicated to multimodal image analysis of brain tumor studies. It performs volumetric segmentation of healthy and tumor tissues by employing multispectral MRI sequences (currently T1, T1-contrast, T2-contrast, and FLAIR). Segmented tissues include Gray Matter (GM), White Matter (WM), Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF), necrotic core, edema, non-enhancing tumor and enhancing tumor.
