We introduce CoNtRol, a web-based framework for analysis of chemical reaction networks (CRNs). It is designed to be both extensible and simple to use, complementing existing CRN-related tools. CoNtRol currently implements a number of necessary and/or sufficient structural tests for multiple equilibria, stable periodic orbits, convergence to equilibria and persistence, with the potential for incorporation of further tests.
