With decreasing costs of generating DNA sequence data, genome and metagenome projects have become accessible to a wider scientific community. However, to extract meaningful information and visualize the data remain challenging. We here introduce FARAO, a highly scalable software for organization, visualization and integration of annotation and read coverage data that can also combine output data from several bioinformatics tools. The capabilities of FARAO can greatly aid analyses of genomic and metagenomic datasets. Availability and Implementation: FARAO is implemented in Perl and is supported under Unix-like operative systems, including Linux and macOS. The Perl source code is freely available for down-load under the MIT License from
