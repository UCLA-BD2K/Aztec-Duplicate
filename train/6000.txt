A digital Atlas of mouse embryonic development consisting of a database of anatomical terms that includes the names of anatomical structures that are found at different stages of mouse embryo development, and a set of 3D volumetric digital embryo models at different stages of mouse development. It is based on the definitive books of mouse embryonic development by Theiler (1989) and Kaufman (1992) yet extends these studies by creating a series of interactive three-dimensional computer models of mouse embryos at successive stages of development with defined anatomical domains linked to a stage-by-stage ontology of anatomical names.
