Motivation: The S/TQ cluster domain (SCD) constitutes a new type of protein domain that is not defined by sequence similarity but by the presence of multiple S/TQ motifs within a variable stretch of amino acids. SCDs are recognized targets for DNA damage response (DDR) kinases like ATM and ATR. Characterizing DDR targets is of significant interest. The aim of this work was to develop a web-based tool to allow for easy identification and visualization of SCDs within specific proteins or in whole proteome sets, a feature not supported by current domain and motif search tools. Results: We have developed an algorithm that (i) generates a list of all proteins in an organism containing at least one user-defined SCD within their sequence, or (ii) identifies and renders a visual representation of all user-defined SCDs present in a single sequence or batch of sequences. Availability and implementation: The application was developed using Pearl and Python, and is available at the following
