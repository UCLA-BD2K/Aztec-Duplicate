isoScale is a proteomics software to quantify peptides based on the total ion intensity of the MS/MS spectra. The software provides also relative quantification of isobaric peptides co-fragmented in MS/MS spectra which share the same sequence but have distinct localizations of post-translational modifications (PTMs). The principle of the quantification is described in Pesavento et al. (Analytical Chemistry, 2006). We recommend the use of the software for middle-down or top-down analyses, as it is suitable for direct comparison of single sequences with scrambled combinatorial PTMs. The user interface provides a choice for CID/HCD or ETD fragmentation. It is suitable for high and low resolution data, as it allows the choice of MS/MS ion tolerance for searching the fragment ions required to calculate the fragment ion relative ratio of isobaric peptides (FIRR).
