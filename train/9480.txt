Motivation: It has recently become possible to build reliable de novo models of proteins if a multiple sequence alignment (MSA) of at least 1000 homologous sequences can be built. Methods of global statistical network analysis can explain the observed correlations between columns in the MSA by a small set of directly coupled pairs of columns. Strong couplings are indicative of residue residue contacts, and from the predicted contacts a structure can be computed. Here, we exploit the structural regularity of paired b-strands that leads to characteristic patterns in the noisy matrices of couplings. The bâb contacts should be detected more reliably than single contacts, reducing the required number of sequences in the MSAs. Results: bbcontacts predicts bâb contacts by detecting these characteristic patterns in the 2D map of coupling scores using two hidden Markov models (HMMs), one for parallel and one for antiparal-lel contacts. b-bulges are modelled as indel states. In contrast to existing methods, bbcontacts uses predicted instead of true secondary structure.
