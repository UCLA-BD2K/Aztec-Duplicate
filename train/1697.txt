KEGGprofile is an annotation and visualization tool which integrated the expression profiles and the function annotation in KEGG pathway maps. The multi-types and multi-groups expression data can be visualized in one pathway map. KEGGprofile facilitated more detailed analysis about the specific function changes inner pathway or temporal correlations in different genes and samples.
