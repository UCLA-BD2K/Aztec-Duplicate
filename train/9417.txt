The advent of high-throughput sequencers (HTS) introduced the need of new tools in order to analyse the large amount of data that those machines are able to produce. The mandatory first step for a wide range of analyses is the alignment of the sequences against a reference genome. We present a major update to our rNA (randomized Numerical Aligner) tool. The main feature of rNA is the fact that it achieves an accuracy greater than the majority of other tools in a feasible amount of time. rNA executables and source codes are freely downloadable at http://iga-rna.sourceforge.net/.
