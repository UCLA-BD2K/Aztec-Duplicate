A large number of genomes have been sequenced, allowing a range of comparative studies. Here, we present the eukaryotic Gene Order Browser with information on the order of protein and non-coding RNA (ncRNA) genes of 74 different eukaryotic species. The browser is able to display a gene of interest together with its genomic context in all species where that gene is present. Thereby, questions related to the evolution of gene organization and non-random gene order may be examined. The browser also provides access to data collected on pairs of adjacent genes that are evolutionarily conserved. Availability: eGOB as well as underlying data are freely available at
