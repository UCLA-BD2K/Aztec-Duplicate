We have developed a novel Bayesian method, PurBayes, to estimate tumor purity and detect intratumor heterogeneity based on next-generation sequencing data of paired tumor-normal tissue samples , which uses finite mixture modeling methods. We demonstrate our approach using simulated data and discuss its performance under varying conditions. Availability: PurBayes is implemented as an R package, and source code is available for download through CRAN at http://cran.r-project. org/packageÂ¼PurBayes.
