Summary: Many Next Generation Sequencing analyses involve the basic manipulation of input sequence data before downstream processing (e.g. searching for specific sequences, format conversion or basic file statistics). The rapidly increasing data volumes involved in NGS make any dataset manipulation a time-consuming and error-prone process. I have developed fqtools; a fast and reliable FASTQ file manipulation suite that can process the full set of valid FASTQ files, including those with multi-line sequences, whilst identifying invalid files. Fqtools is faster than similar tools, and is designed for use in automatic processing pipelines.
        Availability and implementation: fqtools is open source and is available at: https://github.com/alastair-droop/fqtools.
        Supplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
