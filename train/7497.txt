Motivation: Finding biologically causative genotypeâphenotype associations from whole-genome data is difficult due to the large gene feature space to mine, the potential for interactions among genes and phylogenetic correlations between genomes. Associations within phylogentically distinct organisms with unusual molecular mechanisms underlying their phenotype may be particularly difficult to assess. Results: We have developed a new genotypeâphenotype association approach that uses Classification based on Predictive Association Rules (CPAR), and compare it with NETCAR, a recently published association algorithm. Our implementation of CPAR gave on average slightly higher classification accuracy, with approximately 100 time faster running times. Given the influence of phylogenetic correlations in the extraction of genotypeâphenotype association rules, we furthermore propose a novel measure for downweighting the dependence among samples by modeling shared ancestry using conditional mutual information, and demonstrate its complementary nature to traditional mining approaches.
