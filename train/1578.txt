The ability to efficiently represent and manipulate genomic annotations and alignments is playing a central role when it comes to analyze high-throughput sequencing data (a.k.a. NGS data). The package defines general purpose containers for storing genomic intervals. Specialized containers for representing and manipulating short alignments against a reference genome are defined in the GenomicAlignments package.
