An R package that visualizes the GO enrichment results as word clouds and arranges them together with figures of experimental data. This allows us to draw informative summary plots for analyses such as differential expression or clustering, where for each gene list we display its behaviour in the experiment alongside with its GO annotations. The approach is especially interesting for Principal Component Analysis (PCA), where we can annotate the principal axes functionally based on the weights of the genes.
