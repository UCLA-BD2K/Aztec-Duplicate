Appliation for discovering direct or indirect targets of transcription factors using ChIP-chip or ChIP-seq, and microarray or RNA-seq gene expression data. Inputting a list of genes of potential targets of one TF from ChIP-chip or ChIP-seq, and the gene expression results, GeneNetworkBuilder generates a regulatory network of the TF.
