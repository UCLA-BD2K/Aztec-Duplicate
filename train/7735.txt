Coarse-grained (CG) models reduce the cost of molecular dynamics simulations keeping the essence of molecular interactions. Still, the diversity of CG representations (sizes, connect-ivity, naming, etc.) hampers the handling and visualization of such models. SIRAH Tools comprises a set of utilities to convert all-atoms coordinates to arbitrary residue-based CG schemes, write GROMACS' topological information at any resolution into PSF format and a VMD plugin to visualize , analyze and retrieve pseudo-atomistic information from CG trajectories performed with the SIRAH force field. These tools facilitate the use of intricate CG force fields outside the small devel-oper's community. Availability and implementation: Different utilities of SIRAH Tools are written in Perl, Tcl, or R. Documentation and source codes are freely distributed at http://www.sirahff.com.
