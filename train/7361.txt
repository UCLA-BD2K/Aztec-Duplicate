ImLook4D provides full 4D viewing analysis using only the base Matlab toolbox. Originally designed for PET/CT, it is tightly integrated with Matlab, making it suitable for algorithm development and experimentation. Brush-based ROIs may be stored and retrieved. ImLook4D is extensible by drop-in Matlab scripts, of which 20 are provided, and can export its workspace to Matlab and ImageJ.
