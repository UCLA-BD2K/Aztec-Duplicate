TEQC is an R/Bioconductor package for quality assessment of target enrichment experiments. Quality measures comprise specificity and sensitivity of the capture, enrichment, per-target read coverage and its relation to hybridization probe characteristics, coverage uniformity and reproducibility, and read duplicate analysis. Several diagnostic plots allow visual inspection of the data quality. Availability and implementation: TEQC is implemented in the R language (version 2.12.0) and is available as a Bioconductor package for Linux, Windows and MacOS from www.bioconductor .org.
