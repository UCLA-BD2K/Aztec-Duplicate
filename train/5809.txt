SIVIC is an open-source standards-based software framework and application suite for processing and visualization of DICOM MR Spectroscopy data. The SIVIC project provides a standalone, cross platform visualization application and plug-ins for OsiriX and Slicer. The SIVIC c++ framework extends VTK and supports reading, writing, algorithms and visualization classes for MR spectroscopy (MRS) data. The framework is extensible, and community participation and contributions are encouraged to facilitate accessibility and validation of MRS processing methodologies (recon, post-processing, quantification).
