Motivation: The coiled coil is a ubiquitous Î±-helical protein structure domain that directs and facilitates proteinâprotein interactions in a wide variety of biological processes. At the protein-sequence level, coiled coils are quite straightforward and readily recognized via the conspicuous heptad repeats of hydrophobic and polar residues. However, structurally they are more complicated, existing in a range of oligomer states and topologies. Here, we address the issue of predicting coiled-coil oligomeric state from protein sequence.
