APID (Agile Protein Interaction DataAnalyzer) is an interactive bioinformatic web-tool that has been developed to allow exploration and analysis of main currently known information about protein-protein interactions integrated and unified in a common and comparative platform. The analytical and integrative effort done in APID provides an open access frame where all known experimentally validated protein-protein interactions (BIND, BioGRID, DIP, HPRD, IntAct and MINT) are unified in a unique web application that allows an agile exploration of the interactome network and includes certain calculated parameters that weight the reliability of a given interaction (i.e. the "edges" of the interactome network) between two proteins, and also qualify the functional environment around any given protein (i.e. the "nodes" of the interactome network) .
