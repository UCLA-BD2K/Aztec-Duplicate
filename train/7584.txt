ThunderSTORM is an open-source, interactive and modular plug-in for ImageJ designed for automated processing, analysis and visualization of data acquired by single-molecule localization mi-croscopy methods such as photo-activated localization microscopy and stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy. ThunderSTORM offers an extensive collection of processing and post-processing methods so that users can easily adapt the process of analysis to their data. ThunderSTORM also offers a set of tools for creation of simulated data and quantitative performance evaluation of localization algorithms using Monte Carlo simulations. Availability and implementation: ThunderSTORM and the online documentation are both freely accessible at https://code.google. com
