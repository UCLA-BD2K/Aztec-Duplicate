Motivation: Non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (nsSNPs) in voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channels cause diseases with potentially fatal consequences in seemingly healthy individuals. Identifying disease-causing genetic variation will aid presymptomatic diagnosis and treatment of such disorders. NsSNP-effect predictors are hypothesized to perform best when developed for specific gene families. We, thus, created KvSNP: a method that assigns a disease-causing probability to Kv-channel nsSNPs. Results: KvSNP outperforms popular non gene-family-specific methods (SNPs&GO, SIFT and Polyphen) in predicting the disease potential of Kv-channel variants, according to all tested metrics (accuracy, Matthews correlation coefficient and area under receiver operator characteristic curve). Most significantly, it increases the separation of the median predicted disease probabilities between benign and disease-causing SNPs by 26% on the next-best competitor. KvSNP has ranked 172 uncharacterized Kv-channel nsSNPs by disease-causing probability.
