The Microbial Proteomic Resource (MPR) is a repository service that contains non-redundant protein databases of related bacterial strains, which were generated through an in-house developed software called Multi-Strain Mass Spectrometry Prokaryotic DataBase Builder (MSMSpdbb). MSMSpdbb merges and clusters protein sequences inferred from genomic sequences, and provide a protein list in FASTA format that covers for divergence in gene annotation, translational start site choice and presence of single nucleotide polymorphisms and other mutations. Availability: MSMSpdbb was developed in C++ using the Qt libraries (Nokia) and licensed under the GNU General Public License version 2. MSMSpdbb is freely available, and its installation files, instructions for use and additional documentation can be found at the MPR web site http://org.uib.no/prokaryotedb/ can also be found at Proteomecommons.org (see Supplementary Methods for Hash number).
