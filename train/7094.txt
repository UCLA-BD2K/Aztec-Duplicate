NetCmpt is a tool for calculating the competitive potential between pairs of bacterial species. The score describes the effective metabolic overlap (EMO) between two species, derived from analyzing the topology of the corresponding metabolic models. NetCmpt is based on the EMO algorithm, developed and validated in previous studies. It takes as input lists of species-specific enzymatic reactions (EC numbers) and generates a matrix of the potential competition scores between all pairwise combinations. Availability and implementation: NetCmpt is provided as both a web tool and a software package, designed for the use of non-computational biologists. The NetCmpt web tool, software, examples, and documentation are freely available online at
