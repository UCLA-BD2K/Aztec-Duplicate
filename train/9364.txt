Top-down mass spectrometry enables the observation of whole complex proteoforms in biological samples and provides crucial information complementary to bottom-up mass spec-trometry. Because of the complexity of top-down mass spectra and proteoforms, it is a challenging problem to efficiently interpret top-down tandem mass spectra in high-throughput proteome-level proteomics studies. We present TopPIC, a tool that efficiently identifies and characterizes complex proteoforms with unknown primary structure alterations, such as amino acid mutations and post-translational modifications, by searching top-down tandem mass spectra against a protein database.
